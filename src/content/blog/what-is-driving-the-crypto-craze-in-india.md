‘Cryptocurrencies have 4 times more investors than mutual funds’ in India

A CREBACO study claims that the total number of cryptocurrency investors in India is 10.5 crore with investments of over $10 billion

That is as opposed to 2.6 crore unique mutual fund investors.

The government, has indicated that it plans to regulate cryptocurrencies to prevent investors from holding them without any restriction.

I believe technology isn’t inherently good or bad.

It depends on the intention of the user.

Big believer of technology and absolutely bet on futuristic tech for common good, but here is a reminder as old as time – be aware of your why behind your investments.

And that better not be greed.

“All greed starts with an innocent idea: that you are right, deserve to be right, or are owed something for your efforts. It’s a reasonable feeling”
