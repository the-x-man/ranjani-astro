“Create a visual of depicting the conclusion of The Old Man and the Sea”

And here is a **#ChatGPT** generated summary of one of my favourite classics

“The Old Man and the Sea” is a story about an elderly fisherman named Santiago who has been struggling to catch fish for 84 days. On the 85th day, he catches a giant marlin, but it takes him three days to reel it in. During this time, Santiago reflects on his life and his connection to the sea. When he finally catches the marlin, he must fight off sharks that are attracted to its scent. Although he loses the meat of the fish, Santiago feels a sense of accomplishment and respect for the marlin. He returns to his village with the skeleton of the fish, and the villagers admire his bravery and determination. The story ends with Santiago dreaming of lions on the beaches of Africa”

“Any sufficiently advanced **technology** is indistinguishable from **magic**.”
