Are there people who have helped you, you haven’t thanked?

I had no offers on Day 0 of my MBA placements.

Zilch on Day 1.

By Day 2, I was inconsolable.

FMCG’s thought I was had too much of a tech experience. Marketing thought I wasn’t creative enough.

And I didn’t take failure too well.

After Engineering, I had 4 offers before I joined Oracle. And for some silly reason, I attributed my value to how others perceived me or how much I scored.

‘I am a silver medalist, yet I cannot seem to convert one offer’, I whined to my then fiancé, now husband (who poor thing, must have wondered if this is what arranged marriages meant).

So while I sat dispirited in my hostel room, one of my batchmates from the placement committee, walked in to remind me to try again. And that no one apart from myself was judging.

And I did get through that one.

And in hindsight, yes, I am not creative enough for Marketing and still do not have passion for FMCG as much as I do for Tech. So in retrospect, I am quite glad for how things turned out.

I recalled this when I was writing my gratitude journal this morning.

I don’t think I have ever thanked her for it.

So thank you, [Sonam B Vij](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#). For not giving up on me. When I almost did.

And if you are where I was, remember the rule of 10-10-10

Think not only about how you feel in the moment, but also ten minutes, ten months, and ten years from now. Then decide.

If it isn’t something that you would be ashamed about 10 years from now – don’t let it kill you today.
