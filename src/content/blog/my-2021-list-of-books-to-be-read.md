This is the compendium of all the books I usually add to my TBR list in my journal.

I plan to do this documenting online this year to help folks pick books for the #52in52bookclub challenge.

Stay tuned for this.

A few points to note before we get to the list –

1. This is an ever evolving list of books

3. If you have a recommendation – please drop a comment with the title, rating and why you would recommend it to a friend
