I finally got my act together to write about the most popular MooC of all time yesterday – ‘[Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)‘ – Powerful mental tools to master tough subjects. 

It is created by [Barbara Oakley](http://www.barbaraoakley.com/) (University of Oakland) and [Terry Sejnowski](http://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski/) (the Salk Institute) and it focuses on how we can use neuroscience to fine-tune our abilities to learn.

1. Every time I push myself to get something done and in the process get overwhelmed I am reminded of my grandmom’s story of ‘s_top to sharpen the axe_‘. This is definitely one that would fall in that category. Pausing to think about how we learn – in terms of techniques used by experts, how to deal with procrastination and mastering difficult subjects is bound to help all – a student, professional or just someone who is curious about the world around.

This iteration of the course on Coursera started on 8th Jan – below are my notes and reading recommendations from Week 1.

Here is Barbara Oakland’s TEDx speech on the topic before we get started

**Week 1 – Notes**

**Reading Recommendations** – Most of the content of the course is based on the book by the same author- [‘A Mind for Numbers’ ](https://www.amazon.in/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515647713&sr=8-1&keywords=a+mind+for+numbers)

Most of the tools and techniques recommended is drawn from research and findings in the areas of cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

**Section 1 – Focused and Diffused Thinking**

Our thinking pattern often switches between these two neural states. Diffused thinking is mostly one which corresponds to the neural resting state. The brain cannot function in both states at the same time (it is like two sides to a coin)

1. **PinBall Machine Analogy** : The way the brain works can be thought of as a pinball machine. Familiar thought pattern travels smoothly across strong neural pathways, much like traveling through a paved road. New neural patterns on the other hand are weaker.Â \[Side Note\] – Analogies and Metaphors are great way for learning new things and formed strong pathways.
2. **Diffused thinking mode**  – Some specific examples of great thinkers who used this mode of thinking successfully include [Salvadore Dali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador%5FDal%C3%AD), the creative genius who was considered ‘wild and crazy’. His genius ideas were often drawn from diffused thinking periods when he rested on a chair thinking about open-ended questions and go into the ‘free-thinking-mode’ with a bunch of keys held in his hands. He would eventually fall asleep and drop his key bunch and thereby wake up to the clanking noise. Once awake he could then gather the diffused mode points and apply it to his art. Barbara also extend this example to Albert Einstein doing the same exercise, albeit whilst thinking about science and holding a bunch of ball-bearings in his hand instead.
3. **Regular practice** – The key to resolving problems therefore is to switch between the two modes of thinking with the mind going back and forth, especially in the cases of not so common problems. To build a strong neural structure, practicing a little bit of this every day helps.
4. **Understanding the working of the brain** – The brain is one of the most complex devices in the entire world. We are not consciously aware about how the brain works or influences thought processes. We have a billion or more synapses. Brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures. Synapses are less than a micron in diameter and they are constantly changing when we learn. This implies that we aren’t the same person when we wake up as vs the person who went to bed. Let us just think about that for a minute – _‘You are different people at different points in your life-time’_
5. It is possible to take advantage of our unconscious mind in the sleep to improve performance

**Section 2 – Procrastination, Memory and Sleep** 

1. When we look at something we really ‘aren’t keen on doing’, our brain perceives it as equivalent to ‘pain’ and does whatever is possible to divert attention to something else so as to make the pain go away.
2. **Neural Discomfort** though disappears if you work through the initial bit of unease that you feel.
3. **\[Technique alert\]** – [Pomodoro Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro%5FTechnique) is something that can help you through this. It involves setting a timer to 25 minutes to focus on a particular task with absolutely no distractions \[Reminded me of the psychological state of ‘[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow%5F%28psychology%29)‘\] and then taking a 5 minute break to let the mind recoup, wander and gather its thoughts. I personally use [KanbanFlow.com](https://kanbanflow.com) for this and absolutely vouch for the efficacy of the technique. I get more done in 3-5 stretches of uninterrupted Pomodoros’ than would the entire rest of the day.
4. **Practice makes permanent and why math and science are seemingly frustrating to many** – Many folks find the concepts more frustrating in math and science than in others, say literature. This is mostly because mathematical ideas are not analogous to other concrete examples. What this implies is that we need to practice to give our brain a chance to gather the concepts and build stronger pathways.
5. **Neuron Patterns & Pathways** – Neurons become linked together because of repeated use. Practice makes permanent.![](https://i0.wp.com/thetrifecta.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/download-300x150.jpg?resize=300%2C150)
6. **Avoiding Procrastination** – The key thus is to Focus intently > take a break > focus. The neutral mode allows the gathered information to sink in.

**Section 3 – Chunking**

1. We have two types of memory systems – long term memory and working memory systems.
2. **Working Memory system** – It is the one that you consciously use currently (present in the prefrontal cortex). At any given point in time it can hold a maximum of only 4 chunks of information. It is often needed to repeat the information to be remembered (recall repeating the phone number?). It can thus be thought of as an ‘inefficient black board’. This is thus also **limited in nature.**
3. **Long term memory system** – This is distributed across the brain and can be thought of as an efficient warehouse. It is recommended to revisit this a few times in order to find it when needed more efficiently. The warehouse capacity can be immense and all fundamental techniques and concepts are held here.
4. **Spaced repetition** – This is the key to remembering and moving concepts from working to long term memory. Also it is important to repeat it over days instead of cramming it all on one day.
5. **Importance of sleep in learning** – When we sleep our brain cells shrink and fluid is then able to wash out the collected toxin which then enables us to think better the next day. Apart from this sleep also helps tidy the concepts picked up during the day and helps retain them better while de-activating unrelated concepts. Also reading about concepts before bed or thinking about them makes once clarify them during sleep.

**Section 4 – Interview with Terrence Sejnowski**

1. How do we best learn new stuff – Get hands dirty. Get into a lab and learn through doing and through osmosis (learning from other experts)
2. How do we attend to what you do not like? – Ask a question/Active engagement
3. Technique that has helped? – Use diffused mode thinking – walking, jogging, free-thinking allows new ideas to bubble up. Take a notebook along.
4. Resist multi-tasking. Context switching between tasks is individual dependent.
5. How do you apply knowledge of neuroscience to own learning? -Â ‘All neurons we had at birth, wiring takes place and learning happens’. Hippocampus — new neurons are born even in adulthood. If you have a animal(rat) and if you give an enriched environment and look at the Hippocampus – it is much stronger than one in an impoverished environment. Be surrounded by people who stimulate you. In absence of that – exercise is very helpful. New educational systems – recess is thus essential. Brain needs a moment of pause to process the information.
6. Advise about learning? – Success isn’t necessarily about being smart. It mostly comes from passion and persistence. And Grit.

Cant wait for the next week’s sessions. Much love till then!
