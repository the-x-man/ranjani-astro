There are 70 days left to end the year. Are there goals you are yet to achieve?

Boxing is something I hugely enjoyed as part of my fitness goals. Especially when it was against the spouse ðŸ™‚

Thanks to the excessive lifting though, I had an abdominal hernia and then COVID happened, throwing a spanner in the works

Since I trust processes drive results â€“ here is mine for the rest of the year

Start interval training with sprints at 6.45 AM each day for 30 mins. A lesser extreme version of Tabata. Targeted at reducing the fat % from an â€˜acceptableâ€™ 26% to a â€˜fitâ€™ 20-24%

Thats it.

Do you have a daily goal you want to follow for the remaining 70 days? Drop a comment to hold yourself accountable!
