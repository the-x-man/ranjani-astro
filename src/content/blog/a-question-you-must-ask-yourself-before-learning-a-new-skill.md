I was close to burning out a few months ago with all the things I wanted to do and the finite time we have.

Here is a tip that helped take a step back and evaluate.

You don’t land your next role by doing more of what you are already doing.

Scaling requires very different skills including learning when and where to intervene to support your teams.

It also requires one to learn quickly and effectively.

To effectively learn, before you start, figure out if it’s a hard skill or a soft skill.

Hard Skills – Require Repeatable precision. Think practising music.

This is found in specialised pursuits – physical sport, for example.

In such cases your goal is to – “Always be consistent”

Soft Skills – Highly flexible skills.

Those that have many paths to a good result. This is more about being agile and interactive.

About recognising patterns as they unfold and making smart, timely choices.

This is found in broader, less specialised pursuits. Example – involving communication, stock trading or a CEO reading a room.

It is harder to master and requires focussed efforts.

Here is a litmus test to identify the category

If a teacher/coach is involved in the early stages, it is more likely a hard skill.

So next time, before you start on something, pause to ask if it is a hard or a soft skill.
