Are Services firms are out of runway?

Is it time to move away from Labor Arbitrage and conform to Technology Arbitrage?

This well researched article provides insights driving the industry and recommendations of the new wave

“The new S-curve of Value Creation will be AI-driven Technology Arbitrage.

The “scale of technology partnerships” becomes far more important in the technology arbitrage era versus “the scale of people” in the labor arbitrage era.

The fundamental value creation lever in the legacy Labor Arbitrage era has been the centralization of people in a global delivery model. The fundamental value lever in the Technology Arbitrage era is all about architecting and orchestrating the rapidly changing technology ecosystem in line with the client’s business model.”

If you are part of this ecosystem, do you see similar trends?
