IQ doesn’t drop based on geography. But access could.

My biggest fear thence, is the lack of equitable distribution of benefits and access to AI, especially in developing countries that tend to play catch up – as we move towards AGI.

Technology inherently isn’t good or bad.

It is dependent on how we intend for it to be.

And how does putting a pause on AI influence ‘the we’? Would that completely stop those who choose to, behind closed doors?

Who should be the ‘we’?

How can we incentivise markets for collective good?

Building in public vs behind closed doors could allow for free market access and real world feedback

Risks and very real. Responsible AI is critical.

And that is why this view from [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is closest to how I think about what a pause to AI would imply.

As [Atul Batra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) reiterates, are we just ‘pushing the can down the road’?

What is your view on experts call to ‘pause AI experiments’?
