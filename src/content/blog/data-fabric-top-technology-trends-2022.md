“Research shows that up to 74% of data is not analyzed in most organizations and up to 82% of enterprises are inhibited by data silos”

Top Technology Trends 2022 – #2 Data Fabric

1) WHAT : A data fabric architecture provides a connective tissue between data endpoints— enabling the full breadth of data management capabilities including integration, discovery, governance, curation, and orchestration

2) WHY : Top performing enterprises are data driven. However, several challenges block them from fully exploiting all data. Lack of data access. Numerous data sources and data types. Data integration complexities.

3) VALUE : A data fabric’s real value is its ability to dynamically improve data usage with its inbuilt analytics, cutting data management efforts by up to 70% and accelerating time to value.

4) BUSINESS OUTCOME : With a data fabric, your business users and data scientists can access trusted data faster for their applications, analytics, AI and machine learning models, and business process automation, helping to improve decision making and drive digital transformation

It can

* Enable self-service data consumption and collaboration
* Automate governance, data protection and security enabled by active metadata
* Automate data engineering tasks and augment data integration

5) “By 2024 data fabric deployments will quadruple efficiency in data utilization while cutting human-driven data management tasks in half” – Gartner

Disparate data and trusted data availability for agile analysis is such a core issue and a relatable problem.

This seems quite a utopian solution, if it could work. How do you see this helping out enterprises?
