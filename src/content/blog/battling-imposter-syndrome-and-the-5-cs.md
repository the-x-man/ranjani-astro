I receive at least a couple of DMs each week from young women.

Smart, competent women battling imposter syndrome.

“I don’t feel confident enough to ask for the role…. what if folks judge me… why will anyone listen to me… what if they say no…”

Tell you what, I struggle with it all the time. Everyone does.

I have stated this before and I will reiterate this again – the 5C’s for young women out there

**#1Connect** – It is critical to put yourself out there – showcase your capabilities and connect with others who can help charter your career path. Nurture your network – and not just when you need it.

**#2Constantly** Learn – We live in a remote first, knowledge economy. The only way to stay relevant is to constantly work towards staying relevant. Identify your purpose and work towards staying true to it.

**#3Courage** – There is plenty of research that talks about how women are less likely to ask for a referral or a raise. It is important to have a voice and speak up for yourself.

**#4Call** for help – We need to ask for help and support. Build a support system at home. Reach out and get mentors. And most importantly, help other women. We need to help each other.

**#5Confidence** to dream big and believe in yourself – Most women I speak to, do not necessarily have a skill gap but a lack of confidence to walk the path they seek – for fear of failure.

Dream big, be open to fail, to learn and move ahead!
