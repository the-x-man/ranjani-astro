You don’t control you Luck

But you can increase your Luck Surface Area

“In philosophy, a razor is a principle or rule of thumb that allows one to eliminate unlikely explanations for a phenomenon, or avoid unnecessary actions”

Of all the razors, this is one of my favourites.

At any point in time, work towards increasing your luck surface area.

How? Help luck work for you

For example, attend a meet-up about a passionate topic vs bingeing on a new series

Meet folks across the org for a virtual coffee chat

Always help connect folks to opportunities even when it may not work for you

Be nice and be respectful

Check in with your mentors even when you don’t need to.

Spend 25 mins each day learning about a topic you want to master.

Experiment vs Planning

“Start Doing, Amplify by Telling”

What course do you recommend to learn GenAI for beginners?

That is a question I oft get.

We are always on a look out for that one thing that produces a miracle

The one course that would make us an AI expert

The best course is one that you start doing 🙂

Microsoft has this neat repository for Generative AI for Beginners – A 12 Lesson course teaching everything you need to know to start building Generative AI applications

So if you are interested in working on or understanding LLMs and Gen AI, this might be a good one to start with.

Tag someone you think might benefit from this.

‘Best Story Wins’ – Why stories are more powerful than statistics

A long time ago, the org and BU I was part of, had partnered with a consulting org to define the strategy and goals it should focus on in the short and longer term to maintain the edge on customer experience

A couple of folks on my team worked with the consultants to mine through the data to create the analysis.

I recall an data scientist joking, ‘ It is the same data we have and analysis we have done’

On the final presentation though, one slide struck a lot of folks – it highlighted the ups and downs across the customer journey for ONE customer, backed by numbers.

The story of the customer and their pain and delight points across their journey was powerful to influence action though.

I was reminded of this as I was reading [Morgan Housel](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s latest book ‘Same as Ever’ highlighting what remain the same, over time.

Like human nature to be drawn to stories.

“The Best Story wins.

Not the best idea, or the right idea, or the most rational idea.

Just whoever tells a story that catches people’s attention and gets them to nod their heads is the one who tends to be rewarded”

While this may seem counter-intuitive from someone who makes a living from numbers, I tend to agree – people love outcomes backed with so what – not R- squared values.

‘Morgan Freeman can narrate a grocery list and bring people to tears, while an inarticulate scientist might cure a disease and go unnoticed.

If you are proficient with tech and can tell a story about what it implies to business and customer outcomes, you almost certainly will get ahead in this new AI driven world.

I’d add to this – If you don’t tell your story – who you are and what you want to stand for – someone else will 🙂

What are you reading this weekend?

Are Services firms are out of runway?

Is it time to move away from Labor Arbitrage and conform to Technology Arbitrage?

This well researched article provides insights driving the industry and recommendations of the new wave

“The new S-curve of Value Creation will be AI-driven Technology Arbitrage.

The “scale of technology partnerships” becomes far more important in the technology arbitrage era versus “the scale of people” in the labor arbitrage era.

The fundamental value creation lever in the legacy Labor Arbitrage era has been the centralization of people in a global delivery model. The fundamental value lever in the Technology Arbitrage era is all about architecting and orchestrating the rapidly changing technology ecosystem in line with the client’s business model.”

If you are part of this ecosystem, do you see similar trends?

Today I am going to introduce a recent AI research paper in 5 mins.

Why?

Knowing uncommon knowledge that is true, is leverage – that comes from research, not just news.

And its also forcing function for me to learn each day

So today, we talk about – ‘Orca 2: Teaching Small Language Models How to Reason ‘.

TL:DR –

“Orca 2 models, by implementing a variety of reasoning techniques and recognizing the most effective solution strategy for each task, achieve performance levels comparable to, and often exceeding, models that are much larger, especially on zero-shot reasoning tasks. 

Though these models still exhibit limitations and constraints inherent to their base models, they show a promising potential for future improvement, especially in terms of better reasoning capabilities, control and safety…

While frontier models will continue to demonstrate superior capabilities, we believe that research toward building more capable smaller models will help pave the way for new applications that require different deployment scenarios and trade offs between efficiency and capability”

P.S : My focus is only to introduce the research, not to judge it.

There is a lot of details and nuance I cannot capture in 5 mins.

Why invest in an Equitable world – Introducing our new **#RISE** weekend mentoring series

[Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I recently spent our time talking in a panel about AI to fresh-faced college students at IIM – Shillong.

That evening during dinner at our hotel – this fancy place we stayed in – we met this young gentlemen who served us food. He struck up a conversation and asked us about why we were at the IIM.

“I have studied Hospitality Management, do you think they will allow me to do a Masters’ in Hospitality Management there, Sir? he asked, naively.

“I am the first generation graduate and would love to explore what I can do more of”, he added. For some reason that really hit me hard.

Even as we grow tech in leaps and bounds, something I oft wonder about is how can we ensure we do so but equitably?

A personal value of mine is to help folks ‘live their potential’ – no matter who they are or where they come from.

So [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I are committed to give back through our mentoring initiative ‘**#RISE**‘ – for what seems common knowledge to some may be of benefit to others.

Towards that, we commit to spending time each weekend giving back to the community. In the future we hope to cover more around leadership, scaling the broken rung to leadership for women and Gen AI fundamentals

This weekend though, we will start with a session for Young Tech professionals in our Career Kickstarter 101 series.

We believe tech is democratising

And each person should be able to live to their potential

In this session we will cover your top areas of concern – from how to identify roles aligned to your key interests, refining your resume to other open questions you always have had as a young professional

Please share your questions ahead of time

P.S – We value your time. And ours.

To keep it to folks who take this seriously, we are adding a nominal value to the session.

Session capped to a small audience to keep it interactive – use the link in comments to block and add your question for us.

My advise to founders – “Don’t do the hard stuff right now. It you choose hard, do technically hard stuff that enables a giant breakthrough in terms of a use case but don’t do the hard market.

Because there are so many easy markets right now and you if you are grinding and grinding and not getting customer attention, its not worth it right now.

Now 5 years from now when the use of these technologies are a bit more saturated – thats when you got to go do the more hard stuff”

This was Elad Gill from his podcast ‘No Priors’ – referring to the Gen AI ecosystem

“When new technology shifts and disrupts a new market, you actually want to just do the easy stuff

why do the hard stuff?

why not do the low hanging fruits”

I tend to agree.

I talk to a lot of start ups

And whilst it isn’t about solving hard technical problems

Its about choosing your markets and niche areas wisely

Are you building in the Gen AI space

I am always looking to learn more about startups in this space, pls DM

Is SuperIntelligent AI inevitable?

Thus asks [Max Tegmark](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) in his latest TED AI 2023 talk.

“Once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control”

The TL;DR is that AI development is coming to us faster than we anticipated and AI safety is paramount.

He talks about how we are focussed on training the AI not to state specific things ie like financial advice but the focus should be on ensuring it is not ‘doing’

And why guardrails are important – that is still in the realm of ‘trying’ while we need fool-proof mechanisms to guard against mal-intention – both from the machine or Machine+man

While a lot of this can be considered a hype or science fiction – it is worthwhile to note that, that a lot of what we see around us was one day, just that – science fiction

He introduces the paper he co-authored with Steve Omohundro – “PROVABLY SAFE SYSTEMS: THE ONLY PATH TO CONTROLLABLE AGI”

He puts Mathematical proof as central to their approach to AGI safety

‘We argue that mathematical proof is humanity’s most powerful tool for controlling AGIs. Regardless of how intelligent a system becomes, it cannot prove a mathematical falsehood or do what is provably impossible. And mathematical proofs are cheap to check with inexpensive, extremely reliable hardware.”

A Provably Compliant System (PCS) is a system (hardware, software, social or any combination thereof) that provably meets certain formal specifications.

“In terms of policy, AI would become more like biotech is today. Before a biotech company is allowed to market a new drug, they need to prove to government-appointed experts at e.g. the FDA that it satisfies certain safety standards.

Analogously, before a potentially harmful AI is allowed to be deployed, it would need to prove that it satisfies certain safety standards. In both the biotech and AI cases, these safety standards would be agreed upon by society, but in the AI case, the enforcement would be fully automated: all providers of sufficiently powerful hardware would be mandated to ensure that their hardware would not run code which doesn’t carry a proof of compliance with these standards.”

Give [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01933.pdf) a read over this weekend.

(P.S – On a side-note, much like what Max Tegmark to Jeff Hawkins (A Thousand Brains) argue, we don’t need Super Intelligent AI to have a future of humanity that can benefit from AI – but then, if you have read of AI, Moloch, and the race to the bottom it does help for us to think through AI safety, earlier than later )

I read close to 50 books this year.

Here is one I absolutely recommend

“One of the most important books you’ll ever read.”

Its not just another book on longevity – but one that that focusses “on living better and longer that challenges the conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary physician and leading longevity expert”

Peter Attia perfectly frames the iterations of our healthcare system – 1.0, 2.0, and now 3.0.

He introduces the concept of Medicine 3.0 that consists of 5 broad domains.

1\. Exercise

2\. Nutrition

3\. Sleep

4\. Emotional health

5\. Exogenous Modules (Drugs, hormones, or supplements)

It focusses much on solving for root causes vs symptoms – “There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in”

“..the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that I call the Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction.

To achieve longevity—to live longer and live better for longer—we must understand and confront these causes of slow death.”

I lost my dad at 62 and aware that genetics isn’t on my side – it explains me obsession with healthy eating

The good news though is genetic disposition is only part of the solve – your environment is as much a function of your longevity

“The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance—it is the illusion of knowledge. —Daniel J. Boorstin

We deserve to understand better about how we treat the greatest intrument we will ever own – our bodies

Imagine that you went on a long journey on the sea

Across the years, you end up having to replace or repair the broken parts of the ship.

So much so that when you sail back home, every single component has been replaced – Is the ship then the same as the original one you sailed away with?

Now, imagine another scenario

You are sailing with a brand new ship and end up in a ship wreck

You end up rebuilding a similar ship – Now, is this the same as the original ship?

The ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus’ paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.

The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same ship.

As we increasingly move towards brain-machine interfacing, I wonder what makes us, truly us – what happens when we are AI augmented?

Will that spur a new hierarchy of haves vs have nots?

I am currently reading this sci-fi – ‘Mickey 7’

The basic premise is simple – the protagonist is an ‘expendable’ recruited on dangerous intergalactic missions

One that is biologically recreated – that is, after one iteration dies, a new body is regenerated with most of his memories intact. 

“If I die, you can always make another me”, he says.

The thing with Sci-Fi is – unlike most fiction, these are akin to thought experiments – what if questions that man (or woman) tends to ask

Until it is true.

I don’t know the answer to if Mickey 8 is the same as Mickey 7

Because, it is truly a difficult question to answer – What makes us, us?

[OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s Dev Day demos are great examples where the Gen AI industry is heading

A famous line goes, ‘You don’t need a 7 inch nail but a 7 inch hole’

This is going to manifest itself in how AI is going to get consumed – you aren’t just researching for birthday themes – your need is to throw a fabulous birthday party

And with Agents, Generative AI gets closer to solve the need vs sell a particular outcome

This slick demo shows OpenAI’s head of developer experience demo Assistive AI which leverages natural language as an interface to explore and plan out a vacation

Integrating with code intepreter, retrieval and function calling it steps through the actions it is taking.

Assistive AI acts a precursor to agents

Imagine the use cases especially in Healthcare and Education where agents could democratise tech capabilities across masses with limited access

The future is coming in faster than you think

Growing up with parents who came from a non-tech background, I oft turned to books for answers to life’s gnarly problems.

And then to mentors – finding your curated set of people, or board of advisors to look up is immensely powerful.

Here are a few things I have learnt from them

**#𝟭** 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘂𝗽 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁

Things will fail and when they do, how you address it makes all the difference. When you are having a difficult conversation it is you vs them and their failures or do you look at it as you and the person together against the problem. 

People usually don’t want to mess up – and adapting a growth mindset – that folks are and can change is a self fulfilling prophecy.

**#𝟮** 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘂𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗮𝘆 𝗻𝗼 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆 

One that will catapult us to success or never come again. And most of the time, that isn’t true. If someone is choosing you, it means you are doing something right. And that is the biggest opportunity you can recieve – and if you continue to do good work , those opportunities will continue – and improve – over time

**#𝟯** 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲 

All good things in life come from compounding. Give before you take. Put in the grunt work before you ask what’s in it for me. Do the right thing even if no one is watching.

Are we running out of human-generated data?

I was reading through **#thestateofAI** 2023 report over this weekend – highly recommend for the density of content it manages to wrap into a deck

One of the points it alludes to is scalability of data – “It’s unclear how long human-generated data can sustain AI scaling trends (some estimate that data will be exhausted by LLMs by 2025) and what the effects of adding synthetic data are. Videos and data locked up in enterprises are likely up next. “

“Assuming current data consumption and production rates will hold, research from Epoch AI predicts that “we will have exhausted the stock of low-quality language data by 2030 to 2050, high-quality language data before 2026, and vision data by 2030 to 2060.”, the report states

If you are a startup who has used synthetic data for training, I am extremely curious to hear the results.

How Analytics can help Startups Build Products – A 101 guide

Amongst the hype of GenAI, I wanted to stress that you don’t need to bring in complexity when there is no need for an LLM.

So what is the role of data science in building products?

While it is easy for folks to conflate AI and data science in terms of model building, in essence, DS ‘reduces uncertainty’ and allows a company to compete through understanding the vast unstructured data across multiple data sources

Sequoia did a great write-up on Data informed Product building highlighting the below 4 outcomes

**#1Evaluating** the health of the business : Defining, monitoring, measuring and understanding product health, drivers and variations

**#2Shipping** the right products and features : DS helps drive multiple experiments to guide product teams on optimising for the product based on insights and ensuring the right features get built

**#3Forecast** Outcomes with Prototypes/ Production ML models : Support forecasting future expectations and trends with AI/ML. Ex – think identifying fraudulent activity using production systems

**#4Drive** Product Roadmap and Strategy : Understand user behavior and journey to help set effective product roadmap and strategy

Data informed decision making for startups in building products can be a huge competitive advantage and a differentiator, if set up correctly.

Are you effectively leveraging data science in your startup for product building?

Landmark AI declaration by 28 countries

  
Leading AI nations including US, India and China “have reached a world-first agreement at Bletchley Park establishing a shared understanding of the opportunities and risks posed by frontier AI” yesterday

  
The Bletchley Declaration sets out agreement from 28 nations that there is “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the most significant capabilities of these AI models.”

  
It set out a “two-pronged agenda focused on identifying risks of shared concern and building the scientific understanding of them, and also building cross-country policies to mitigate them”

  
#1“This includes, alongside increased transparency by private actors developing frontier AI capabilities, appropriate evaluation metrics, tools for safety testing, and developing relevant public sector capability and scientific research,” the declaration said.

  
It ‘encouraged transparency and accountability from actors developing frontier AI technology on their plans to measure, monitor and mitigate potentially harmful capabilities’

  
As part of agreeing a forward process for international collaboration on frontier AI safety, The Republic of Korea has agreed to co-host a mini virtual summit on AI in the next 6 months.

  
Why is this a significant step?

  
As an independent journalist shared, “For the first time we now have countries agreeing that we need to look not just independently but collectively at the risks around frontier AI.”

  
“AI knows no borders, and its impact on the world will only deepen”

My ‘kid-in-a- candy-store-moment’

Last weekend, I managed to check off one of my bucket list items of getting a professional photoshoot done.

Thanks to being invited to [TANISHQ JEWLLERYS](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) launch of their new festive collection – like how cool is it to get to try out any of their gorgeous pieces!

Being the nerd that I am, my mom has been amused about my fascination with professional shoots and dramatics as much as I want to write a book.

‘What a disparate list of things you have on your bucket-list’, she jokes.

Well.

As Gaiman says, “You’re alive. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything.”

Tesla released its Full Self-Driving capability demo in Austin recently

“FSD capability features use vision neural networks to perceive & understand the world, just like humans do.

Why is this an immense step forward?

Co-incidentally, I am currently reading Walter Isaacson’ biography of Elon and he talks about wanting to have FSD from way back in 2017

And his maniacal focus on making it ‘vision-based’ and trying to do away with Radar – especially when everyone else in the category was moving towards it

So its interesting to see this being achieved – ‘making decisions and actioning them based only on visual input from cameras’

Also, it reminds me of a research around how we tend to have harsher criteria in judging errors made by machines vs humans.

P.S – The one key reason I have loved visiting Austin was that my ex-boss had the latest Tesla model(s) and always gave us a ride.

The sheer brilliance of what a well designed machine can do is an ode to good engineering.

Way back in 2002, my dad’s physicians missed a medical anomaly

Which if flagged earlier, it might have given him more years

It wasn’t intentional but a product of how our burgeoning healthcare systems are set up – not always optimised for patient enablement

Tech could help with that

And that is why, of all the use-cases of Gen AI, the one I would put my money on and passionate to learn more about is Healthcare

As a [Boston Consulting Group (BCG)](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) paper called out, “Generative AI won’t replace the doctor-patient relationship. But it will make doctors—along with pharmaceutical companies, med-techs, and other health care organizations—even better at what they do”

The speaker highlights the use-case of how it took 40 years to develop a drug for Tuberculosis – why? “Because it wasn’t a disease in the priority markets”

“With AI you could de-risk and improve the development cycles…. Which means you will bring the right products to the right people much more quickly than before”

Pharma Companies use AI to –

**#Accelerate** the process of generating new protein and drug molecules by 10X

**#Reduce** time spent on admin processes by 50%

Check out the paper in comments around the other use cases across healthcare

Have you come across a sector or use case leveraging GenAI for good?

How much have language models improved over the last few years? Here is an analogy

“If air travel had improved at the same rate as LLMs, average flight speed would have improved from 600mph in 2018 to 900,000mph in 2020—a 1,500x increase in two years.

Instead of taking eight hours to travel from London to New York, it would take just 19 seconds (!).”

Explaining how LLMs work is hard.

Including transformers and why the seminal paper around Attention made a huge difference

Here is a good simple to understand 101 guide

“Containment of Technology is not possible”

What is the “Containment problem – how do we keep a grip on the most valuable technologies invented as they get cheaper and spread faster?”

And why are they so hard to contain?

General purpose technologies such as AI and Synthetic Biology share 4 key features that explain why this isn’t Business as Usual, argues, Mustafa Suleyman

In his new book, ‘The Coming Wave : Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century’s Greatest Dilemma”

**#1** They are inherently general and therefore omni-use.

Example – Think of ways in which AI is and can get leveraged across sectors and use cases

**#2** They hyper-evolve

**#3** They have asymmetric impact

**#4** And in some respect, they are increasingly autonomous

The creation of this tech is driven by powerful incentives, geopolitical competition, massive rewards and open distributed culture of research.

The coming decade, he speculates will make us the most productive in history – a ‘step change in capability – introducing both risks and innovation at an awesome scale’

A lot of the rest of the book is on how Suleyman speculates regarding HOW to contain these technologies

Sometimes it feels like Alice in Wonderland and all I can say is, It gets ‘curiouser and curiouser’ 🙂

Yesterday, I got an ‘Inspiring Women in AI and Analytics” award at [3AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/3aiplatform/)‘s Gen AI Max Conference  
  
Even as I was collecting it, there is this teensy voice in my head that goes,  
‘What really have you done to deserve it? There is so much you are a failure at”  
Maybe. Maybe not.  
The only thing that pushes me past the fear is Appa – and my need to make him proud.  
  
Every time I am on a stage giving a keynote or getting a recognition, the person I miss the most, is my dad. So much so, that it physically hurts  
  
My first job was with Oracle  
Appa dropped me for my interviews at 9.00 AM and stood at the gates waiting for me.  
I had a bunch of back to back technical rounds.  
I don’t think I had a phone so after clearing each one, I’d rush out to tell him.  
He stood right there all day until I finally came out, offer in hand, at around 4.30PM.  
Beaming proudly, taking me to the temple close by and then buying me ice cream.  
He believed in me – unabashedly so.  
  
So this is for him.  
And for that young girl who came up to acknowledge how good it was to see an Women in AI.  
  
May you find the one person who trusts in you. Unconditionally.  
Sometimes, thats all you need.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s Global Talent Trends report states that job posts mentioning AI or Generative AI (GAI) have more than doubled (2.2x) globally in the last two years

And applications for these posts have grown 17% faster compared to those that don’t mention AI or GAI. 

This trend is set to continue

If you are looking at growing in this space, here are a few pointers

👉 **#1** Focus on the value and not on the shiny objects

A long while ago my team worked on leveraging language models for understanding top customer issues. I had a bunch of PhDs on my team and we explored the latest in the space at that point in time, from BERT to various LDA models. In the end, the one that worked was a combination of SME driven heuristics + supervised approach

Rarely does success lie in the algorithm alone. Understanding the context of the data, business, risks and preparing to fail fast helps tremendously.

As a leader, work towards creating a culture that allows this to happen

👉 **#2** Leader or IC, get your hands dirty

There is nothing more demotivating for the teams than to have strategic plans thrown at them which rarely takes into consideration the ground realities.

Given the speed at which things move in this space, whether you are an individual contributor or a leader, the best way to learn is to get into the weeds to understand why and how things work.

It helps provide better guidance to the teams + teams like working for technical leaders

👉 **#3** Learn Tech in the context of business implications

A lot of folks seek to learn the tech – from how multi-head attention models work to deploying at scale. Whilst this is important, put it in context of the business implications. When an LLM is open sourced, think about what this means to the way it could commoditise that layer – not just how one can now access it easier

👉 **#4** Teach

The best way to learn, according to Feynman is to teach. Explaining things to others is hugely clarifying. Form close knit learning communities to share what you learn on a regular basis

👉 **#5** Build

A mentor once told me, ‘prepare to fail well’.

Rarely does AI work in one iteration. Build. Fail. Learn. Iterate.

What would you add to the list?

Why the age of post-smartphone wearable AI devices may be near

Humane – a start-up from ex-Apple execs reveals the first AI device – the Ai Pin – at Coperni’s Paris fashion show

The company describes it as a “screenless, standalone device and software platform built from the ground up for AI”

My first thought was how closely it resembles the Apple gestalt of products and the second was privacy

The clothing based wearable uses a range of sensors to perform functions like AI-powered optical recognition, but is also supposedly “privacy-first” thanks to qualities like no wake word and thus no “always on” listening.”

“It also comes with laser projected display and built to harness AI for a post-smartphone era”

“Supermodel Naomi Campbell is the first person outside of the company to wear the device in public, ahead of its full unveiling on November 9,” Humane wrote.

What are your thoughts on AI devices that “morph into extensions of our bodies, minds and hearts?”

Why does Sam Altman want to now venture into AI hardware?

The article reports that ‘renowned iPhone designer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have been in talks about collaborating on a new consumer AI hardware device – including what “new hardware for the AI age could look like.

In one of the keynotes, Nadella talks about a key lever influencing the current AI proliference – Natural Language Interface.

In one of the Gen AI panel discussions I was on, a panelists called out “Part of the reason for the AI boom today is putting an UI in front of an AI”

Could hardware play a similar role – especially for folks who aren’t in the knowledge work space?

The Coming Wave – AI, Power and 21st century’s Greatest Dilemma

I am currently reading this book by Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Deepmind that talks about how the coming decade “will be defined by this wave of powerful, fast-proliferating new technologies.

Driven by overwhelming political and commercial incentives, these tools will help address our global challenges and create vast wealth – but also upheaval on a once unimaginable scale”

“As our fragile governments sleepwalk into disaster, we face an existential dilemma: unprecedented harms arising from unchecked openness on one side, the threat of overbearing surveillance on the other.

Can we forge a narrow path between catastrophe and dystopia?”

I truly believe that Technology, inherently isn’t good or bad

It depends on the views of the creator

So something I think about oft is whether we are creating a future we want out kids to live in

Whilst the best we can do right now is to be aware – both for ourselves and our kids, a visual I want to leave you with is this

How Tech drives GDP growth. Unquestionably

So whilst we may not have all the answers doesn’t mean one should stop seeking to ask questions

Stay Curious

How easy to use developer tooling can help AI drive value in non Tech

In an insightful session of the future opportunities of Gen AI, Andrew Ng talks about this long tail – one where tech firms with billions of users could pump in a lot of resources to drive high value AI projects

One that was hard for custom use-cases specifically in non tech to emulate – wouldn’t make sense to hire 100s of engineers on a 1M project.

But the trend he highlights that could break this is the increasing prevalence of easy to use developer tools

Such as Text or Visual prompting or Data Centric AI – that could democratise the benefits to the right side of the chart – non tech

One, as he rightly calls out is a larger part of the economy

“The opportunity that lies ahead of us in Generative AI is to find diverse and deep use cases and build them”

How do you build defensible businesses with **#GenerativeAI**

I was listening to [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s talk at [Stanford University](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) on ‘The Opportunities in AI’

He made a highly relevant observation – one I see in a lot of startups I talk to that sounds like a hammer in search of a nail.

He shared the use case of Lensa – an app that allowed one to take picture of self and render as astronaut/scientist etc

After a spike in revenue, it dropped rapidly flatlining post the passing fad.

Why?

It was a good idea but it was thin software layer over a powerful API – “a useful product but not a defensible business or created long term business value”

The key thus, he calls out, to build sustainable businesses is to build, “Really deep and really hard applications that hopefully can create long term value”

And thus states that true work that lies ahead of us is to ‘finding diverse use-cases and to build them’

Are you looking at Problem first – Tech second?

Would you consider paying for an ad-free Facebook?

Meta is considering introducing paid version of Facebook and Instagram for **European users**, giving them access to endless ad-free scrolling

Why? EU’s stringent data governance policies limit the company’s ability to deliver targeted advertisements in the region.

This is a big move if it happens from Meta in terms of challenging its core business model

To put things in perspective, its core business is a “$110bn+ advertising monolith that’s leaps ahead of its rivals in extracting value from users”

Which means “$18 every single month for each one of its US & Canadian users — substantially more than the $10-15 a month you might pay for services like Netflix, Spotify or Amazon Prime”

This is also interesting to think of when you think of how subscription models will turn up for other services we use.

I haven’t used Facebook for years now but I doubt if this market would rather pay for the subscription to avoid personalised ads. Or to prevent any form of personal data based customisation for that matter.

Thoughts?

Will AI save the world or close off a better future for humanity?

When I was in 7th or 8th we moved to a new neighbourhood that was next to one of the poshest locations in the city.

As I gazed out at the manicured lawns and huge bungalows, I asked Appa – “They have such an unfair advantage, Appa. How can I even compete against them as the salaried class”?

Appa smiled his always composed smile and said something I oft recollect.

‘Don’t compete on what is different – compete on what is the same : knowledge and time’

We live in an unfair world – there will always be folks with an advantage.

Whilst that isn’t something you can control – one thing I hope to leave my daughter with is the ability to use knowledge and awareness to one’s advantage.

Knowledge is the ultimate leveller

“The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function”

As you get bombarded by the evolving future of AI, seek to learn both sides of the argument

And then use your discretion with the information you have at that time.

Here are two extremely opposing views on the future of AI

Highly recommend you read both. Deeply.

And then think about what factors influenced each of the authors.

“Learn how to learn

from those you disagree with

or even offend you. See if you can find

the truth in what they believe.” – Kevin Kelly

When a tech debuts at the peak of the hype cycle

Gartner released the 2023 version of its hype curve for emerging technology , and as expected, generative AI debuted right at the peak of inflated expectations.

To put it in perspective ChatGPT debuted less than a year ago.

Another point to ponder is when you are at the peak, the only way to go is down.

As always, a reminder of Problem First, Tech Second.

Thoughts on the GenAI positioning in the Hype cycle?

Generative AI: The state of the market—where is the business impact?

There is a lot of vague views on potential of Gen AI and adoption across Enterprises

This IBM report addresses three key areas –

**#1** What are the business priorities for implementation? In simple parlance, why are Enterprises investing – to innovate faster or engage with customers better?

**#2** While we do this, what do Enterprises expect to see as measurable tangible benefits and do they have an org level strategy?

**#3** To prepare for the disruption, what are the three key areas of focus that Enterprise leaders should look at? From Org and Skills, Risks and Governance to Data and Platforms?

Thoughts on other factors impacting Enterprise-wide Gen AI adoption to drive impact?

“We find that 84% of LinkedIn members are in occupations that could leverage GAI to automate at least a quarter of routine tasks and increase productivity”, states [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) Economic Graph report

“Our analysis suggests that most jobs require skills that can be performed by GAI technologies, but not every job will be affected in the same way”

They go on to identify 3 groups of occupations:

**#1Augmented** by GAI – These jobs’ core skills include a large share of both of GAI replicable and GAI complementary skills. Ex : Data Analysts automate the computation and interpretation of metrics with GAI, enabling them to focus their time on GAI complementary skills, such as cross-functional influencing and stakeholder engagement.

**#2Disrupted** by GAI – These jobs’ core skills include a large share of GAI-replicable and a relatively low share of GAI complementary skills. Ex – Language translators’ skills shift from doing translations from scratch to reviewing and certifying machine-generated translations, or to specializing on specific legal or literary domains

**#3Insulated** from GAI – These jobs have a relatively small proportion of GAI replicable skills in their core skills. Ex – Real estate agents might utilize GAI for writing house descriptions, but core relationship management skills would be insulated from GAI.

The chart below gives a categorisation of 600 occupations.

Warning: Humans cannot reliably detect speech deepfakes

A study published earlier this month found that humans can only detect deepfake speech 73% of the time.

Listeners only correctly spotted the deepfakes 73% of the time, and there was no difference in detectability between the two languages tested – English and Mandarin.

Speech deepfakes are artificial voices generated by machine learning models. Due to rapid research progress, it is possible to produce a realistic-sounding clone using only a few audio samples

What does this imply?

“As speech synthesis algorithms improve and become more realistic, we can expect the detection task to become harder.

The difficulty of detecting speech deepfakes confirms their potential for misuse and signals that defenses against this threat are needed”

Full paper – <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0285333>

What do you think are potential means to tackle this?

Do not use AI as a 0 or 1 option. But rather as a co-pilot to help you work better and faster.

Say you want to write about a topic – thinking about it in extremes is flawed ie, I will write it myself from scratch or I need AI to give me a completely automated version

Rather think of it as a coach – one that can help you get started

And one you can fine-tune further

Below is a blog outline for a Gen AI tech stack 101 written completely by AI.

Is it perfect? No.

Is it aligned to what I had in mind? No

Is it a good first step? Yes

Learning to work along with AI is possibly the one skill I’d recommend all of us master

“Half life of knowledge is decreasing

Careers are more like a Pie vs T shaped”

I thoroughly enjoyed this discussion with [Srikanth Velamakanni](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), the co-founder and Chief Executive of Fractal Analytics.

He is someone I admire for being able to balance well between the strategy and the weeds of challenges in execution – something I have seen few executives do so well.

He is a thought leader, independent board director, and member of NASSCOM executive council and someone whose work in this space I admire and follow

**#Episode7**: Why we are at the cusp of something big with Gen AI and what you should know about it?

We cover a lot of ground here –

**#1** What’s different now? A mental model of how to think about GenAI and how it is different from the AI journey thus far?

**#2** Talent/career lens here – How should folks across early, mid management and executives look at leveraging Gen AI to stay relevant

**#3** What should India’s strategy be wrt Generative AI? How do we play to our strengths? What should we be wary about?

**#4** Industry and Ecosystem Trends- What does the GenAI ecosystem look like now: How are large players seeking to evolve? 

**#5** What are the most important use cases and products in this space? Areas that will be most prone to disruption and then what they can do

“Being able to feel safe with other people is probably the single most important aspect of mental health; safe connections are fundamental to meaningful and satisfying lives.”

Mental health isn’t something I took seriously

It is something I read about but didn’t reflect upon much.

Only when I got myself a coach and talked through what was on my mind did I realise how much I ignored my health in general – and brute force I was using to power through it all or the self criticism, isn’t self compassion.

I followed the Scarlett O’Hara rule – if you have read Gone with the Wind – ‘After all, tomorrow is another day’, putting away the important in lieu of the urgent.

The Body keeps Score is my 27th book of the year – and hands-down the best one I have read this year.

The researcher spent his career studying how children and adults adapt to traumatic experiences

He uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers’ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust.

He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain’s natural neuroplasticity.

If you are like I, who is extremely self critical and working on developing self compassion, I’d highly recommend this one

Heard of Worldcoin’s launch? And a straight out of Sci-Fi orb that is used for biometric verification process to prove you are human

What is Worldcoin and what is the strategy behind it?

Sam Altman is one of the co-founders of Worldcoin – a digital identity and crypto payments project that aims to achieve global scale alignment.

Here are 5 things you should know:

1️⃣ Mission: Worldcoin aims to distribute billions of tokens worldwide via airdrop while proving that you are human.

They are building the world’s largest identity and financial network as a public utility, giving ownership to everyone

.

2️⃣ Technology: Worldcoin is a digital currency secured by cryptography, similar to Bitcoin. However, it is more advanced and business-friendly. It leverages blockchain technologies and is part of the web3 concept, which involves decentralization and the use of blockchain in various applications

3️⃣ Airdrop Strategy: Worldcoin’s strategy involves distributing tokens via airdrop to billions of people globally. This approach helps in verifying human identity and ensuring wider distribution of the currency

4️⃣ Identity and Financial Network: Worldcoin’s vision is to create the world’s largest identity and financial network. By providing ownership to everyone, they aim to establish a public utility that can empower individuals and communities

5️⃣ Challenges : Worldcoin has faced challenges and controversies, including concerns about the use of biometrics and authentication technology.

Sometimes all of this reminds me of a conversation I remember having with Appa about the Stock Markets when I started working –

“There is so much that I don’t understand, Appa. How does all of this work?”

“There are players and those who play them in the world, Ammu.

There always will be – just focus on what’s within your control” 🙂

What is your take on World Coin?

My parents were both English literature graduates

And worked state government jobs.

Stable desk jobs they did for 30 odd years until they retired.

Appa never understood why I was so fascinated with Tech.

“Its like magic, Appa, look” – I remember showing him my first program.

He smiled, like only a parent could.

And stood steadfast in supporting me – driving me down to multiple interviews and dissing away relatives who were worried about marriage prospects.

Tech is truly magical in more ways than one.

For one, it is democratising – when used for good

And that is why this startup feature warms my heart.

“Before she started using this app, 30-year-old Chandrika had just 184 rupees ($2.25) in her bank account.

But in return for around six hours of work spread over several days in late April, she received 2,570 rupees ($31.30). That’s roughly the same amount she makes in a month of working as a teacher at a distant school, after the cost of the three buses it takes her to get there and back.

Unlike her day job, the app doesn’t make her wait until the end of the month for payment; money lands in her bank account in just a few hours.

Just by reading text aloud in her native language of Kannada, spoken by around 60 million people mostly in central and southern India, Chandrika has used this app to earn an hourly wage of about $5, nearly 20 times the Indian minimum.

Part of that demand comes from tech companies seeking to build out their AI tools. Another big chunk comes from academia and governments, especially in India, where English and Hindi have long held outsize precedence in a nation of some 1.4 billion people with 22 official languages and at least 780 more indigenous ones.

This rising demand means that hundreds of millions of Indians are suddenly in control of a scarce and newly-valuable asset: their mother tongue”

This cover by [TIME](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) features a [nasscom](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) Deep tech startup – [Karya](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), founded by a Stanford Alumni, [Manu Chopra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), a 27 year old who has like most other folks leveraged education to move out of the poverty.

It is truly an amalgamation of all the good that tech can bring – helping bring people out of poverty whilst building an ethical and diverse dataset that helps drive responsible AI.

Is Generative AI a hype?

That is a question I get. A lot.

To some extent there is always going to be some hype around new tech.

But largely, I believe, there is humongous value that will be created by Generative AI.

It is like an report called out – an Generational change

Or like I call out in my podcast – An iPhone Moment

McKinsey research pegs that at $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion of value annually.

Which then begs the question – how do we look at adopting and getting value from this?

I come across a lot of fluffy articles around the topic.

But I quite like this one from McKinsey

The research in the below link calls out the 9 actions that CIOs and CTOs can take to reimagine business and technology with generative AI.

Also, have a look at the Gen AI tech stack – highly recommend a read if this is an area that you are even tangentially interested in

📢 Breaking news – Musk to replace Twitter’s blue bird with the ‘X’ logo

Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino announced the upcoming launch of the new X platform, set to ‘revolutionize social media’.

The platform promises to deliver “everything” with unlimited interactivity in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking, and more

1️⃣ Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino insists that X will be the platform that can deliver everything, with no limit to its transformation1

.

2️⃣ Elon Musk, has in the past hinted at his plans to turn Twitter into X or use it to build an entirely new platform, aiming to shake up the world of social media4

“And soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds”, he tweeted

This comes on heels of the his announcement on July 12 launching the new AI company called xAI that aims to “understand the true nature of the universe”.

The team is headed up by Musk and includes team members that have worked at other big names in AI, including OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Google’s DeepMind.

What do you think this implies to the future of AI?

How dual-career couples can make it work?

A few weeks ago I met this person who worked on an extended team during a team lunch.

During the chat he called out how his previous role was as an acting CTO. Mildly surprised, I prodded him further to ask why he then chose the current career path as an individual contributor.

In what sounded like a well thought out, intentional move, he called out how both he and his wife were on fast paced careers and when they had children they took a conscious decision for one person to step back to help out more with the kids.

So while his wife went on to lead the APAC charter, he sounded absolutely content in choosing what he did and seemed happy playing a balanced role at work and home.

It made me both happy to see a man do that as well as wonder if I would even see something like that happen in an environment I’ve grown up in, where the gender roles are more starkly defined.

Whilst that may not be an option for everyone and in the absence of family support, there are always choices to be made.

And that is why talking about career trade-offs and what is important to each (one’s aspirations, career goals, geographies and kids) is so absolutely important to couples

Something that a starry 24 year old me never really thought of when I married, but just got lucky.

But then, we shouldn’t have to depend on luck though to make couples work.

Here is what an [HBR research](https://hbr.org/2019/09/how-dual-career-couples-make-it-work) recommends on the topic

‘In her study of more than 100 couples around the globe, the author found that dual-career couples tend to go through three transitions when they are particularly vulnerable:

– when they first learn to work together as a couple;

– when they go through a midcareer or a midlife reinvention;

– and as they reach the final stages of their careers.

Those who communicate at each transition about deeper work and personal issues such as values, boundaries, and fears have a better chance of emerging stronger from each one, fulfilled both in their relationships and in their careers.”

So are you talking to your spouse about what makes you work?

What do you think of this AI translated demo of Lex Friedman and Mark Z speaking in Hindi

The Twitter user @therealprady built a beta using GPT-4 + prompt engineering for translation

What I do like about it is the preservation of the Original Speakers’ voice and tonality – something that most translations miss

What I do miss, as someone who understands the language, is that it doesn’t in the least represent how a native speaker would converse

More colloquial versions might be what the future would look like (I hope)

Why your superpower may actually be holding you back

Understanding Shadows of Superpower

This [Lenny Rachitsky](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s podcast episode featuring the inimitable [Nikhyl Singhal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is one of the best episodes I have listened to.

Staying away from jargons and wishy-washy messages, this probes deeply into what makes a successful career and being more intentional about how we look at growing in careers

The concept I have reflected on the most is Shadows of Superpowers.

“… And I thought it was an incredibly powerful phrase that everyone focuses on your superpowers, but no one ever thinks about what shadows they create.

Shadows of superpowers to me is the story of a lot of executives. There’s an adage that’s thrown around, which is, what gets you there isn’t what got you here.

It’s sort of the tools that have made you successful today, you need to almost rebuild or relearn to get to the next phase.

….oftentimes people have a great superpower. They go into a performance review, person says, “You’re getting some feedback from your peers that you struggle in collaboration.”

And the manager even sometimes is puzzled, but the individual will say, “Are you kidding me? My last five performance reviews told me that I was one of the best collaborators in the company. How in the world is that possible?”

And then what you realise is that, “Well, you’re collaborating as long as people agreed with your point of view.

Now as a leader, we’re asking you to be opinionated, and because you just think you’re an amazing collaborator using the exact same tool set. And it turns out that when you’re dealing with senior people, that may not even be in your function, they may not be product, they may not be tech, they recoil, but you’re moving so fast because it’s your superpower.

You would never think that this needs to be rebuilt.” 

What is the shadow of your superpower?

Do give this one a listen.

Also, highly recommend Nikhyl’s newsletter on substack – probably the only one I diligently read on the topic

[McKinsey & Company](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually

To put that in perspective – the United Kingdom’s entire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. 

Also, in terms of future of work, its highly likely that GenAI replaces tasks before jobs.

“Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities”

True value to orgs come from investing in longer term goals

And that requires being open to iterating through failures

Where are you in this path towards being an AI first?

**#Ep5** How do you self learn Generative AI to 10X your outcomes?

In the latest episode of **#GenerativeAIandI**, I chat with [Conor](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Dean of Students at NYU Stern School of Business, NY Times and **#1** International bestselling author, TEDx Speaker and Head of GenerativeAI@Stern.

He is an epitome of where curiosity can lead you – from self learning GenAI to being an evangelist today in teaching not just his MBA students but also corporate leaders on how to leverage Generative AI to increase productivity. 

He is also totally crushing it with his Youtube channel where he educates folks on AI.

So today we are going to chat with Conor about how to leverage AI more effectively, why it is bound to change the way education works and most importantly how one can self learn Gen AI

Will I fail if I am building a GenAI startup at the application layer?

Almost 99% of the GenAI startups in India I speak to play at the top of the stack. It is also considered the least defensible area.

(There are a couple I have spoken to in the AI tools and Security space – which is very interesting, but a topic for another day)

There are 5000+ AI tools that allow you to design your own courses to create unique sites – check <thereisanaiforthat \[dot\] com.

What you can do, another can replace – hence you should go vertically down the stack could be an answer

Buts it’s a shallow response.

Here is how I tend to think about it – Ask yourself if :

1️⃣ If you are building a JTBD (Jobs to be done) that can be replaced by an existing LLM capability.

2️⃣ If not, is the JBTD exhaustive in solving for a pain the ‘customer desperately wants’ that may extend to capabilities beyond GenAI?

In all honestly, GenAI isn’t a magic wand and you don’t need to force it into your stack – but are you building features that actually help solve a point – GenAI or Otherwise?

The Baptists’, Bootleggers’ and why AI will save the world

**“The Baptists And Bootleggers Of AI**

Economists have observed a longstanding pattern in reform movements of this kind. The actors within movements like these fall into two categories – “Baptists” and “Bootleggers” – drawing on the historical example of the prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920’s:

👉 “Baptists” are the true believer social reformers who legitimately feel – deeply and emotionally, if not rationally – that new restrictions, regulations, and laws are required to prevent societal disaster. For alcohol prohibition, these actors were often literally devout Christians who felt that alcohol was destroying the moral fabric of society. 

For AI risk, these actors are true believers that AI presents one or another existential risks – strap them to a polygraph, they really mean it.

👉 “Bootleggers” are the self-interested opportunists who stand to financially profit by the imposition of new restrictions, regulations, and laws that insulate them from competitors. For alcohol prohibition, these were the literal bootleggers who made a fortune selling illicit alcohol to Americans when legitimate alcohol sales were banned. 

For AI risk, these are CEOs who stand to make more money if regulatory barriers are erected that form a cartel of government-blessed AI vendors protected from new startup and open source competition – the software version of “too big to fail” banks.”

As I read through this, it strikes me about how much this is driven by Western Philosophy – we keep up with China or we lose.

And while I am an equally optimistic proponent of tech for good, this leans towards painting a rosy picture without necessarily calling out the challenges in getting to what we all seek –

Building a future we would like our kids to live in.

**#ScalewithGenerativeAI** Part2 – How to talk to VCs

Speak the language of the person at the other end of the table.

I spoke to this really smart co-founder with 20+ years of technical expertise in AI security.

Brilliant guy who is working on building a curated bespoke platform.

It took me 20 mins though to get to the crux of what it meant for the customer.

VCs I talk to tell me they decide funding/pass in the first 5-10 mins of talking to founders

So provide ‘Answers first’ – not the AI capabilities.

Start with what it means to the customer – Why should they buy you and what do you solve with AI.

The before and after story

And then quantify it

Latency improves by 5X of <baseline> as measured by <>

How do I build a a defensible GenAI startup as a founder?

Every tech startup I mentor has different problems.

Some on GTM, others on product roadmap and most on getting pilot customers.

Here are 5 reasons how successful startups operate differently

1️⃣ Are you a hammer in search of a nail?

8 out of 10 folks I speak to have solutions that look like wrappers to existing LLMs – wanting to jump onto the AI bandwagon or pivoting from Web3.

2️⃣ In times of change, focus on what remains the same – the fundamentals : The best CEOs and founders I have spoken to focus not on the hype but on foundations – what is the problem the customers “desperately want to solve for”

An Healthcare AI CEO recently shared the life-changing experience of how one of their patients learnt about an anomaly that would have resulted in a 90% heart blockage because of the capabilities their AI tools allow them to capture their historical health trends that were earlier missed by their physicians

3️⃣ Problem first, Tech second :

Not all of the solutions need Generative AI – I would even argue that less than 10% of the capabilities really need to be generative. But yes, it has brought in new focus on even traditional discriminative AI.

4️⃣ Obsessive about solving for customers JTBD

I love the jobs to be done framework. Like the popular adage goes, do you need a 9 inch nail or a 9 inch hole?

Founders who obsess about JTBD – how can I help B2B customers understand the plant meat market with a curated GPT generated research saving weeks of consulting expense/time vs a I am building a ‘faster photo editor’

5️⃣ Governance and Integrity – Are you playing the long game.

Integrity and customer value tend to go together. In this new world where responsible AI is still getting defined, the ones I tend to trust are the ones who do the right thing – even when no one is watching.

Or governing.

**#ScalewithGenerativeAI** is a **#WeeklySeries** I am running on mentoring **#TechStartups** and **#SmallBusinesses** to leverage the power of AI to scale.

There are only 3 books that have made me cry

This one tops the list.

Ever so often, when I am overwhelmed with the world around me, I pause to think of the worst case scenario.

And realise I have already been in one.

Watching a loved one pass away, feeling helpless and distraught isn’t something I would wish on anyone.

But that moment stays etched within you through eternity – muttering under one’s breath to make them proud even as you see them slipping away.

It is a void that never really goes away.

But death, puts living into perspective. And is a reminder of what truly matters.

“There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.” – Paul Kalanithi, When Breath Becomes Air

NASSCOM :

Under nasscom’s Future of work initiative, we had organised a webinar on Generative AI: Implications on Work and Workforce.  
  
The stellar panel comprising thought leaders from [Atlassian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atlassian/), [Deloitte](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deloitte/), [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/) and [Tech Mahindra](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tech-mahindra/) took us through the realities of Generative AI and what this means for the future of work. Here are a few key takeaways:  
  
– Important to understand what Generative AI is/isn’t; what it can/can’t do  
– Important to identify the problem to be solved and then apply the technology  
– Most enterprises are exploring how they could apply Gen AI to their business  
– Emerging areas: Enterprise search, analytics, dashboarding, recommendation systems  
– High impact verticals: Sports, Media & Entertainment, Healthcare  
– Generating new business: Marketplace for Prompts  
– Rapid skilling is priority: The need to be intelligent to be productive; Master self-learning  
– One big ask for India’s academia is to focus on ensuring that the talent pool has their fundamentals in place esp. in the fields of Mathematics, Probability and Statistics  
– India can be a great test bed for Generative AI  
– An important concern highlighted was: How do we know what is real vs. AI generated? Need to have guardrails in place

5 questions to evaluate the culture of an org during your interview process.

While we evaluate offers based on factors from compensation to titles, here are some red flags to look out for and points to assess before you take the call!

1️⃣ Are the recruiters supporting you through the hiring process : Great orgs have recruiters who play more of a partner role through your interviewing process. They want you to succeed and thus support you with context and content required to prepare you for each round – not just schedule them

2️⃣ How do your interviewers address your questions and concerns – Are they being transparent about what works or isn’t. Are they being very prescriptive or do you have the ability to drive changes. Are you an executor or a strategizer – or what combination of both

3️⃣ Do they live the company values : Can they highlight instances where the values aren’t just bullets on the wall.

4️⃣ How inclusive is the culture in action?

I once interviewed with an org where I didn’t meet a single diverse leader across the 7 rounds – a huge red flag personally.

5️⃣ How close is the maturity of the environment to what you seek : Many a time, I hear job seekers talk a lot about the the org but ask very little to assess the maturity of the team they are joining. A nascent org has very different problems and focus vs a mature one. And that has a huge impact on where, how and with whom you will work.

What else would you add to this list?

👀 How Nvidia may be inching towards the $1Tn club!

Sell shovels during a gold rush, they say

With the AI gold rush, NVIDIA just added $200 billion in market cap and they may be on their way to becoming the first $1 Trillion chip company

“As tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta rush to build AI capabilities similar to ChatGPT, they need pricey chips and as WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains, that’s good for Nvidia”

Nvidia late on Wednesday announced a second-quarter revenue target more than 50% above Wall Street estimates with plans to boost supply to meet surging demand for its AI chips, which are used to power popular services including ChatGPT.

What a ride!

And what a time to be alive 🙂

💥 Meta just announced its new AI model – “Massively Multilingual Speech”

👉 Identifies 4,000+ spoken languages ->

For example, existing speech recognition models only cover approximately 100 languages — a fraction of the 7,000+ known languages spoken on the planet

👉 Can do speech to text and text to speech in 1100 languages – a 10x increase from earlier capabilities.

👉 The capabilities of the open sourced makes it easier for people to connect and access information in their language

It also could bring in immense value to people who rely entirely on voice to access information.

The exponential growth of tech happening around us is indeed insane

Imagine if you could talk to a dead celebrity with AI?

Are you looking for accurate answers? Maybe not. Because there are no right/wrong answers

Business outcomes on the other hand, require accuracy

Which is why Gen AI in B2B works better as a ‘coaching network’ as Emergence puts it.

Here is why the state of Gen AI today works differently for B2B vs B2C use cases

![1️⃣](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/31-20e3.svg) Play COACH to humans where accuracy is critical – Business use cases require accuracy. “In order for businesses to feel confident in using generative AI for most use cases, more context and human assistance will be required”

![2️⃣](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/32-20e3.svg) GenAI is Output oriented, not outcome oriented – “ChatGPT can spit out taglines for a new beverage brand, but it can’t tell you which one performs better”

Businesses are usually driven by outcomes.

![3️⃣](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/33-20e3.svg) GenAI is broad vs deep

“…to move the needle in many business use cases, the AI needs to be trained on company-specific data”

Foundational base models today lack context to specific use cases. This is where fine-tuning specific models with specific data over base models, could provide ‘strong, defensible ROI”

It was a cold December morning and I pulled my scarf up.

Dad and I were on an adventure.

Dad said a two wheeler would work better to navigate the narrow roads. He was right.

We had to stop every few metres to ask for directions – in an era when navigation didn’t exist.

My 3rd language in school was Kannada – a subject I quite detested.

I oft got the genders and/or the syntax wrong.

And in 12th grade, that stood between me and getting my perfect score.

We were on the quest for a text book we couldn’t find – one that I was I was adamant would get me my 90+ score in Kannada.

Dad relented – he had managed to find out where the author lived. The author of this little known Kannada text book. We would go right to the source to procure one if we had to.

After narrow gullies, traffic that is a constant and getting drenched in a light Bangalore showers, we finally arrived.

I stood in front of this fading brick house with red hibiscus covering the gates, wondering how to introduce myself.

It was near dusk by the time we procured what we went looking for – this book with a yellow dust jacket with bold red font.

Proud with our victory, we rode back hoping not to face Amma’s ire.

As I sat pillion holding on to Appa, I read phrases from it. Maybe it was derived Sanskrit.

I can’t find the Kannada version but there is one verse recall vividly.

“Chithe chinthe yor madhye bindu matra visheshta,

Chithe dahati nirjeevam

Chinthe dahati jeevitham”

“Chithe” (ಚಿತೆ i.e. Pyre) and “Chinthe” (ಚಿಂತೆ i.e. Worry) are said to be same, difference is just a dot.

“Chithe (Pyre) burns the dead, while Chinthe (Worry) burns the living”

There is no lessons here.

Just spend time with your parents.

You never know what lone memory you will retain after years.

“When I left for college, I had many decades left with living parents, but only about one year of time left to spend with them.” – Tim Urban

Do you have a favourite memory with your parents?

Get more done in 2 hours than most folks get through in a day

How to use Temptation Bundling to get your top 3 things done.

Here is something I use that is tried and tested – the Bundle of 5 technique

**#1** Start your day with a 10 min timer. List out stuff you need to get done into 3 buckets of 5 each.

**#2** Add ONE must do item in each of the 3 buckets. This is usually one I have been putting off for a while or big gnarly goals that need chipping off.

**#3** Temptation bundling – Now add the remaining 4 as simple tasks that give you joy to cross off the list. Or one’s you really would look forward to – a reward to getting things done.

**#4** Block out a 2 hour deep work slot.

This varies by the person – I do 5AM – 7AM and 10 AM -12 PM. This holds true for both personal tasks and at your workplace.

Figure out slots that work for you.

**#5** Work with Pomodoros

I use kanbanflow\[dot\]com to work in 25 min pomodoros with 5 min breaks. Pause all notifications. Leave the mobile outside. GSD.

I still end up crossing off only half of the list

But that is ok. Move the incomplete ones to the next day.

Here is an example of a personal bundle of 5

**#1** Complete Purchasing NPS \[ Top Activity\]

**#2** Set up time with new Fin Advisor \[Quick check box activities\]

**#3** Check podcast status on Apple \[Quick check box activities\]

**#4** Purchase CG products \[Temptation bundle\]

**#5** Call Mom \[Temptation bundle\]

In the world of excess or attention deficit, hyperfocus is an advantage

How do you deep work?

#30daysofGenerativeAI #2MinGenAINews

  
There are 100s of Gen AI tools released each day

Used effectively, they could hugely help improve productivity

  
But very few of us actually are aware of them. Let alone use them.

Staying relevant requisites constant up skilling.

  
So here are short 2 min snippets of cool AI tools and GenAI news that I learn about each day.

Will ChatGPT replace your family doctor?

With a high risk pregnancy, I singularly attribute getting out of it alive to my physicians and the medical care I had available.

But then, I had the privilege of having a slew of specialists who were there to help – a factor that is non-existed for a large sector of the population.

“In the pretend world where your family doctor would actually respond to a text, the labor-cost would be 11,000x higher than the cost to query chatGPT” stated a futurist

Could the impact be more meaningful in less-well-developed healthcare systems?

Or in situations that aren’t chronic.

Who bears responsibility when things go south?

Is the sample size of the study even significant enough to make such strong claims?

Thin line. And I don’t know. Yet.

Would you ask for medical advise from artificial intelligence chatbot assistant?

Day19/30 **#30daysofGenerativeAI**

How do orgs make money from Generative AI?

While Google went the path taking on ChatGPT with Bard, Amazon has focused on enabling others to build generative AI applications/integrations to their product suite.

And this is why that could be a smart move.

🔥 💬 “I think there will be a small handful of fundamental large models out there that other people build on.

But right now what happens is a company makes a large language model (API enabled to build on top of it), and I think there will be a middle layer that becomes really important where… I’m skeptical of all of the startups that are trying to train their own models.

I don’t think that’s going to keep going. But what I think will happen is there’ll be a whole new set of startups that take an existing very large model of the future and tune it, which is not just fine tuning, all of the things you can do.

I think there’ll be a lot of access provided to create the model for medicine or using a computer or a friend or whatever.

And then those companies will create a lot of enduring value because they will have a special version of it.

They won’t have to have created the base model, but they will have created something they can use just for themselves or share with others that has this unique data flywheel going that improves over time and all of that.

So I think there will be a lot of value created in that middle layer. ” 💬 🔥 – Sam Altman

While the likes of Open AI have verticalized tech stack – from infra to compute, there is bound to be a market for customised sector specific focus, say healthcare.

While these smaller players lack the deep pockets for the infra that Open AI has, what they still can do is to build and finetune on the existing base models.

And offerings such as Amazon Bedrock could help there

“Bedrock makes several foundational models from Amazon and other companies available via API.

What makes it compelling is that it makes it really easy to point to some AWS S3 data, and fine-tune the models for your specific task at hand. This is perfect for companies looking to easily integrate generative in their products”

Here is a TL DR of Amazon’s capabilities

👉 Bedrock – enabling developers to leverage existing base models

👉 Amazon EC2 Trn1n and Inf2 – Train models cheaper and faster ie reduce cost of generative AI

👉 Amazon CodeWhisperer – The Github co-pilot equivalent : help developers code with generative AI

Such an absolutely exciting (and terrifying) space to watch unfold 🙂

“…It’s interesting that if you ask people 10 years ago about how AI was going to have an impact, … you would’ve heard, first,

it’s going to come for the blue collar jobs working in the factories, truck drivers, whatever.

Then it will come for the low skill white collar jobs.

Then the very high skill, really high IQ white collar jobs, like a programmer or whatever.

And then very last of all and maybe never, it’s going to take the creative jobs. And it’s going exactly the other direction” – Sam Altman

🤖 Here are other key take-aways from OpenAI’s Sam Altman’s episode on the New Frontiers of AI with GreyMatter Podcasts

🔍 Focus on the middle layer: One important area of focus in AI is the “middle layer,” or the layer between data and applications. This layer is important for making sense of data and translating it into actionable insights.

🤝 Alignment and self-improvement: Another important consideration in AI is ensuring that AI systems are aligned with human values and goals. Additionally, self-improvement is important for AI systems to continue to learn and grow over time.

🌙 Moonshots: As with any new technology, there are many moonshot ideas being explored in the AI field. These ideas may seem crazy or impossible now, but they could have a big impact in the future.

💡 Applications of AI: One exciting trend in AI is the decreasing cost of both energy and intelligence. This means that AI is becoming more accessible and can be applied to a wider range of problems.

🌐 Metaverse and AI: The concept of the metaverse is becoming increasingly popular, and AI will likely play a big role in shaping the future of the metaverse.

🚫 What won’t change with AI: While AI will bring many changes to our world, some things will remain the same. For example, human creativity and emotions are not likely to be fully replaced by AI.

The field has evolved a lot in a short amount of time, and it will continue to do so in the years ahead.

💁‍♀️💁‍♀️ 7 harsh truths as a working women and a parent.

[Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I mentor this young girl.

Two years into her first job, she was contemplating her next career move – should she look at doing a MS in US or move into data sciences?

As Vignesh prodded her more about her why, she teared up – “I want to prove myself to my family and to the world. I want to do something impactful and have an identity for myself. It’s important to make my dad proud…” she trailed off.

I found a bit of myself in her from 15 years ago.

My parents were English literature graduates in government jobs.

They didn’t understand why I was so passionate about tech or even how to help. But they stood steadfast, supporting me in all that I chose to do.

Here are 7 reflections you learn over time –

1️⃣ As a working women and parent, whether you earn as much or more than your spouse, the mental load of managing the household still falls largely on women – can you have it all? It is immensely tiring and needs constant trade-offs. Try it any way.

2️⃣ There will be times you wonder if it’s ok to ask for that raise or promotion, apply for that role or raise your hand up for an opportunity you aren’t 100% qualified for. Do it anyway.

3️⃣ You will be faced with scenarios where you wonder if you are enough, have to try harder, be the only person who looks like you in the room or ask yourself ‘why will people listen to you’ – Put yourself out there, any way.

4️⃣ The lesser dissonance there is between what you do and what you ‘want’ to do – the happier you tend to be. There isn’t a magic wand that will get you from A to B. Strive to move closer, each day.

5️⃣ Even when there are multiple folks who will undermine your each move and be micro aggressive, there are bound to be leaders, mentors and allies who will lean in to push you up – work to get closer to them, each day

6️⃣ You will mess up. Your first time doing some thing. As an individual or a manager. You will fail or make people upset – reflect and learn to do better.

Stand up, dust yourself and try again, each day.

Do right by yourself. Even if no one is watching.

7️⃣ Your priorities will change over time. From financial freedom, titles, charter, promotions to ultimately freedom over time and fulfilment. You can only see what is ahead of you. And health is the only thing that really matters.

As Gaiman says, strive to make good art. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself.

Happy Vishu to those who celebrating the new year!

We are not training GPT 5 right now says Sam Altman.

“An earlier version of the letter claimed OpenAI is training GPT-5 right now. We are not and won’t for some time.

We are doing other things on top of GPT-4 that I think have all sorts of safety issues that are important to address and were totally left out”

Sam Altman, in an address at MIT, responded to the letter calling for a 6 month halt in AI.

He also adds that ‘We believe putting it out in the world will help us understand upsides and downsides and is worth the tradeoff even though we can end up embarrassing ourselves sometimes”

What are your thought on the need for regulation to deal with the disruption from **#GenerativeAI**?

Ok. AutoGPT might just be the next big step in AI.

Here is a video from twitter user @SullyOmarr on building a complex website that ‘Took \~10 minutes at a cost of $0.50″

Here’s why Karpathy recently said “AutoGPT is the next frontier of prompt engineering”

You can now give a task to an AI agent and have it autonomously develop and manage different kinds of tasks

“1 GPT call is a bit like 1 thought. Stringing them together in loops creates agents that can perceive, think, and act, their goals defined in English in prompts,” stated Andrej Karpathy, predicting a future of “AutoOrgs” made up of “AutoCEOs,” “AutoCFOs,” and so on.

– Like creating a website in mins

– or Parsing through Amazon to pick up the prices for identified products

AutoGPT has internet access, long-term and short-term memory management, text generation, and integration with 11 Labs (AI text to speech gen)

And it can operate ‘autonomously’

And I am done book-marking AI links – it genuinely is a space that is too fast to catch up

Look at who joined me at [Indian Institute of Management Bangalore](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) yesterday for a session on **#AIAdoption** for the [Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) community.

Fascinated with the lush green campus and miffed that she didn’t get a stage, A has promised she will start a Youtube channel to ‘teach kids AI’ 😀

It’s endearing to see how easily kids take to technology – as a parent and as a person who works in AI, I sway each day between excitement and fear.

Remind me of Dickens’

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”

Thanks Professor [Dinesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), [Harini Thammaiah](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and the WIDS Bangalore team!

Thoroughly enjoyed being part of the event

💫 JUST IN – Meta AI just released SAM (Segment Anything Model).

✅ It can “cut out” any object, in any image, with a single click and can identify objects within images & videos, even those it hasn’t encountered before.

✅ Segmentation — identifying which image pixels belong to an object — is a core task in computer vision and is used in a broad array of applications, from analyzing scientific imagery to editing photos.

\>> Segment Anything: Works toward the first foundation model for image segmentation

✅ It was built with a goal to build a foundation model for image segmentation: a promptable model that is trained on diverse data and that can adapt to specific tasks, analogous to how prompting is used in natural language processing model

✅ In the future, SAM could be used to help power applications in numerous domains that require finding and segmenting any object in any image. For the AI research community and others, SAM could become a component in larger AI systems for more general multimodal understanding of the world

Imagine the list of possibilities this can bring in across manufacturing to healthcare – from automated quality control with vision systems to improving medical imaging analysis

“Listening to advice from other people should be approached with great caution.” – Sam Altman 

🤖🚀 “AI is going to be one of the defining technologies of our time, and it’s really important that we get it right.”

That’s just one of the many insights shared by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a recent episode of the Lex Fridman Podcast.

Here are 5 key takeaways from the conversation:

1️⃣ AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare to finance to education. As Altman noted, “there’s going to be so much productivity that comes out of the technology” as it continues to evolve.

2️⃣ “These AI systems will make a lot of jobs go away, as is true for every technological revolution, and will also create many new types of jobs that we cannot yet imagine”

3️⃣ One major challenge in developing AI systems is ensuring that they are robust and can function reliably in a variety of contexts. As Altman put it, “the real world is full of surprises and things that are outside the training data.”

4️⃣ OpenAI is focused on promoting collaboration and open access to AI tools and resources. This includes initiatives like the GPT-3 API, which allows developers to build and deploy applications powered by OpenAI’s language model.

5️⃣ In order to realize the full potential of AI, it’s important to prioritize ethical considerations and ensure that the technology is used in a responsible and beneficial way. As Altman noted, “the goal is to build AI that is both powerful and aligned with human values.”

Overall, the discussion provides a good view of how quickly this field is changing – something that we cannot afford to ignore

Highly recommend a listen

Our very first Generative AI Community kick-off session at [nasscom](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is here!

Thanks to [Ramkumar Narayanan](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Atul Batra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) who continue to lead from the front and foster a sense of community – last evening brought in founders, industry experts, VCs and startups to engage in dialogue and network in this exciting space.

The Generative AI space has been touted to be the ‘mosiac moment’ and the energy and passion was evident in the room.

Loved [Dr. Rohini Srivathsa](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s kick-off on the topic – enlightening and sparked a lot of conversations.

Thanks to all those who braved Bangalore traffic to make it and to [Kritika M](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and her team for being such generous hosts!

Personally, I was so honored to get to meet the (very humble) Rajendra Singh Pawar – founder of NIIT and Padma Bhushan awardee.

And meeting some of my most favorite people – [Ramkumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), [P Ramani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Pankaj](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) 🙂

Here is more to come! And I can’t wait to host another community event in this space!’

IQ doesn’t drop based on geography. But access could.

My biggest fear thence, is the lack of equitable distribution of benefits and access to AI, especially in developing countries that tend to play catch up – as we move towards AGI.

Technology inherently isn’t good or bad.

It is dependent on how we intend for it to be.

And how does putting a pause on AI influence ‘the we’? Would that completely stop those who choose to, behind closed doors?

Who should be the ‘we’?

How can we incentivise markets for collective good?

Building in public vs behind closed doors could allow for free market access and real world feedback

Risks and very real. Responsible AI is critical.

And that is why this view from [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is closest to how I think about what a pause to AI would imply.

As [Atul Batra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) reiterates, are we just ‘pushing the can down the road’?

What is your view on experts call to ‘pause AI experiments’?

**#Day12**/30 **#30DaysofGenerativeAI**

🖐🖐 “Will open-source LLMs with decentralized training be competitive with closed-source and centralized LLMs?”

Why is this question from Naval Ravikant an important one to answer ❓ ❓

It determines where the generative AI market will move – towards large LLM providers such as OpenAI or is there a market for smaller, decentralised LLMs customised to specific areas that could be economically viable?

Or is there an hybrid model play?

Naval Ravikant discussed this along with other experts on Airchat.

Here are a key takeaways –

1️⃣ Is it possible to train models in a decentralised manner?

Compute and Data are the most important factors and can this be attempted. And training doesn’t come cheap – Microsoft invested a third round of 10 Bn USD in Jan 2023\. Today we are yet to figure out how to train AI in a decentralised way

2️⃣ Why Open Source

– Open source works better than user interface doesn’t matter like in this scenario where it is all natural language input and output

– Direct access to weights provides better customisation – thus everyone will want their own LLMs

– Eventually training LLMs for a specific use case can work out better than general outcomes

Does all of the mean that could end up in a hybrid scenario – an Oligopoly if you like?

Spicy Topic – Should we let our children play and understand AI tools?

Under parental guidance.

In an article, “We Can’t Keep ChatGPT Out of the Classroom, so Let’s Address the ‘Why’ Behind Our Fears’, an English teacher highlights this –

“ChatGPT offers us an opportunity to address our fears, release our fixation on preventing cheating and focus our attention on more worthy priorities: providing students with compelling reasons to write, inviting them to wrestle with important questions and crafting a piece of writing that cannot be mistaken for a robot’s work”

A lot of what we force our children to do is rote learning and writing – efforts better spent in understanding concepts vs regurgitation.

And keeping them away from learning what is shaping the tech world is akin to leaving them with a handicap.

Teach them how to amplify their efforts working with a tool, not to outsource to it.

For a human with a tool will beat a human without one.

Here is an image my almost 8 year old created using an AI based image generator that in the backend uses controlled diffusion models.

This is an AI generated audio translation + lip sync from English to Hindi.

I don’t completely understand what I am saying but it is impressive how far we have come.

While the syncing can be improved, whats more impressive is that it is from a Generative AI for Media startup incubated right here in India by a couple of sharp guys from IIT Madras.

Very pumped about the Building from India. For the World.

There are decades when nothing happens. And weeks when decades happen.

Keeping up with AI, Red Queen and the Illusion of progress

The faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progress.

This is an increasingly influential idea in evolution, one that recurs across this book Red Queen : Sex and the evolution of Human Nature

And I have been reflecting on this book a lot ever since there is an overwhelm of content on Generative AI.

One of the peculiar features of history, is that time always erodes advantage.

Every invention sooner or later leads to a counter-invention. Every success contains the seeds of its own overthrow.

Every hegemony comes to an end. Cars move through the congested streets of London no faster than horse drawn carriages did a century ago. We do not move cross Silk board in Bangalore any faster in a car than by foot.

“Evolving is not a goal but a means of solving a problem”

Humans therefore will survive not because they are intelligent, but because their intelligence attracts a mate through whom they can successfully reproduce.

The concept that all progress is relative, has come to be known in biology by the name ‘Red Queen’, after a chess piece that Alice meets in ‘Through the Looking Glass’ who perpetually runs without getting very far because the landscape moves with her.

It isnt much different from the Sisphyean Struggle to stay in the same relative place by getting even better at things.

Most folks would agree that in spite of the technological developments of time-saving devices we seem to constantly have less and less free time.

He also talks about another recurring theme – balance between co-operation and conflict. The relationship between a mother and a child is pretty straightforward – both are seeking roughly the same goal – the welfare of themselves as well as each other.

The relationship between a man and a rival for a promotion is also fairly straightforward – both want the worst for the other.

It is one of the oldest themes in the history of life, for it is repeated right down to the level of the gene itself.

Increasingly, this seems to complete a circle – one that reminds us to pause and being mindful of the present.

Of ‘just being’.

Maybe getting to the goal isn’t the necessarily the purpose of life – maybe the journey is

Do we need to go slow to go fast?

What concerns you most about AI?

Yes, there are fears around the AI prevalence, downsides and impact to jobs

While that is an understandable concerns, what worries me the most is this – free markets don’t prioritise to reduce inequity, by default.

“….market forces won’t naturally produce AI products and services that help the poorest.

The opposite is more likely”

What worries me is how we can ensure leveraging tech for good

To solve to reducing inequity vs worsening the gap.

For the thousands who aren’t even aware of how this could and would impact them.

How do we leverage tech for good?

Gates proposes this – “With reliable funding and the right policies, governments and philanthropy can ensure that AIs are used to reduce inequity. Just as the world needs its brightest people focused on its biggest problems, we will need to focus the world’s best AIs on its biggest problems.”

What are your thoughts on this?

**#Day10**/30 **#30DaysofGenerativeAI**

Hot on the heels of GPT4, [Runway](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) launches Gen2 – text prompts to video capabilities.

Gen 2 is a multi-modal AI system that can generate novel videos with text, images, or video clips.

Essentially, ‘If you can say it, you can see it’

What does it allow you to do?

It allows capabilities across 8 different modes from text to video, to video from text and images. It also allows for rendering and stylization.

Runway says it’ll be making its new generative video model, Gen-2, available to users in ‘the coming weeks.’

For context, “Runway offers a web-based video editor that specializes in AI tools like background removal and pose detection. The company helped develop open-source text-to-image model Stable Diffusion and announced its first AI video editing model, Gen-1, in February”

An example video generated by Runway’s Gen-2 model. – The text input prompt was “A shot following a hiker through jungle brush”

Career pivots and How to make them happen?

We oft get questions around how to make career transitions

From a program to a product manager. Or a software engineer to a data scientist.

A long while ago, a technical engineer reached out expressing his interest in becoming a data scientist. Long story short, after 8 weeks of shadowing the role, he realised that there was much more to it than ‘model building’.

He did not enjoy the alignment with stakeholders nor the scouring for data from several sources.

“It’s easy to generate a fantasy in your mind’s eye about what it’d be like to have a different job. But before you take any steps toward making a change, it’s useful to test – is it really something you’d enjoy?”

In today’s **#CoffeeChats**, [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I talk about career pivots and how one can go about it.

Appa stood outside until I finished my day long interview at [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) – my first job.

When I rushed out with an offer that evening, dad took me first to a temple and then to celebrate with ice cream.

The room full of young women – fresh faced, eager about their careers ahead of them reminded me of the girl that day – so joyously looking forth to the world ahead of her.

Someone asked me about ‘How I’d define self worth?’ in the panel yesterday at [Analytics India Magazine](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s Rising’23 Women in Tech conference.

Interestingly, that has changed several times over time

From having financial independence, promotions, titles, charter and growth to being able to meaningful work and having control over my time and do things I love to engage in.

So like the Sunscreen song says, “Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t”

As always, an honour to stage stage with [Pooja Goyal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), [Jayashree Mitra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Vanitha D’Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#). And the lovely moderator [Vijayalakshmi Anandan](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)

**#Day8**/30 **#30DaysofGenerativeAI**

During a gold rush, sell shovels

The content around **#GenerativeAI** is overwhelming. The FOMO is very real.

Are our jobs at stake, is the most common question I hear.

The short answer is – we don’t know we have unleashed until it plays out.

Having said that, the smartest thing you could do is second order thinking. Think beyond what is stated in the headlines.

Like [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) calls out in this [video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ranjanimani%5Fday8-30daysofgenerativeai-generativeai-activity-7042360115915620352-0Waw?utm%5Fsource=share&utm%5Fmedium=member%5Fdesktop),

“Most of the money made off the invention of refrigeration wasn’t by the makers, but companies like Coke. If AI/LLMs are refrigeration and the next Coca-Cola is to be built”

So rather than worry about whether your job will be replaced, think about how you can equip yourself to understand how you can work with technology better.

Because cliched though it sounds,

“AI will not replace you.

A person using AI will”

The Axelrod Tournament and the strategy used to win Prisoner’s Dilemma games

For the uninitiated – here is a summary of Prisoner’s dilemma –

Two prisoners are accused of a crime. If one confesses and the other does not, the one who confesses will be released immediately and the other will spend 20 years in prison. If neither confesses, each will be held only a few months. If both confess, they will each be jailed 15 years

If two players play the prisoner’s dilemma more than once in succession, remember previous actions of their opponent and are allowed to change their strategy accordingly, the game is called the iterated prisoner’s dilemma.

Life is like iterated prisoner’s dilemma games

Robert Axelrod ran an experiment to understand the model that will win in iterated Prisoner’s dilemma games

What is the strategy that won?

Not always betraying your opponent

Or always cooperating

It was Tit for Tat.

Anatol Rapoport won with the strategy of TIT FOR TAT.

TFT starts with cooperate and then does whatever the other person did on the previous move.

The success of the tit-for-tat strategy, which is largely cooperative despite that its name emphasises an adversarial nature, took many by surprise

Having said that, the game was bounded by specific number of rounds and isn’t a complete representation of the real world.

Nonetheless, it is an interesting take on payoffs and how you look at decisions.

**#Day7**/30 **#30DaysofGenerativeAI**

What is **#LangChain** and why is it important?

👉 👉 LangChain is a framework built around LLMs (Large language models)

👉 👉 “LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app – the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge” – And **#Langchain** is the library aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications

👉 👉 “Chains are an important feature of LangChain that allow users to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application”

💬 So as I chat with Startups in this space, there are to clear paths that emerge

1️⃣ You are the infra player with a verticalised path to apps or you are a model+app player customising for a particular use case/niche.

2️⃣ The incumbents train LLMs with publicly available data.

Training on customised, ‘private data’ allows the use cases to be more effective in niche areas.

And LangChain here provides a very effective way to do so.

Here is an use case

💫 “Conversational Memory for LLMs with Langchain”

If you are talking to a person, you expect them to have context to the last conversation you had.

LLMs by default are stateless (process on current input). Here is an application that works on including memory of previous interactions

If you work or are interested in the space of **#generativeAI**, I’d love to hear from you. Please DM with details.

“Why am I not getting promoted”

Taking on the elephant in the room – this is a favourite user question [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I get across our mentoring sessions.

If only there was a straightforward answer

In today’s **#CoffeeChat**, we attempt to deconstruct the various aspects that goes into this decision

And how awareness can allow you to be intentional about how you approach this

For hope is never a good strategy 🙂

With exponentially growing tech comes new scams.

“Scammers are using artificial intelligence to sound more like family members in distress. People are falling for it and losing thousands of dollars”

“Two years ago, even a year ago, you needed a lot of audio to clone a person’s voice,” Farid said. “Now … if you have a Facebook page … or if you’ve recorded a TikTok and your voice is in there for 30 seconds, people can clone your voice.”

“Technology amplifies underlying human forces”

Which is both the good and bad – and as the tech uncovers newer areas of progress, it will also bring with it newer ways of scamming folks.

Please share the word and kindly create awareness with your elders in the family or other who may not be as tech savvy.

Can you guess my Midjourney prompt for this AI generated image?

Please take a guess in the comments before scrolling down for an answer.

“Create a visual of depicting the conclusion of The Old Man and the Sea”

And here is a **#ChatGPT** generated summary of one of my favourite classics

“The Old Man and the Sea” is a story about an elderly fisherman named Santiago who has been struggling to catch fish for 84 days. On the 85th day, he catches a giant marlin, but it takes him three days to reel it in. During this time, Santiago reflects on his life and his connection to the sea. When he finally catches the marlin, he must fight off sharks that are attracted to its scent. Although he loses the meat of the fish, Santiago feels a sense of accomplishment and respect for the marlin. He returns to his village with the skeleton of the fish, and the villagers admire his bravery and determination. The story ends with Santiago dreaming of lions on the beaches of Africa”

“Any sufficiently advanced **technology** is indistinguishable from **magic**.”

A long time ago, one of the teams I worked with, presented a kickass proposal to leadership

They had done all the due diligence, had data to back it up and had a clear strategy and roadmap.

Yet, it did not fly (or land?)

One of the key reasons, that was later uncovered, was not the fault with the solution in itself.

But in whether all key decision makers were aligned with where the problem existed.

Solutioning for something without seeking clarity on whether the decision makers are on the same page with respect to the problem, the extent or the urgency is a primary cause of dysfunction across teams.

So when you see something not working, before you figure out how to fine-tune the solution, question alignment on your problem statement.

A lot of candidates I speak to, during hiring, tend to focus on ways to optimise the solution.

Seek to understand before being understood – an underrated leadership trait.

**#Day5**/30 **#30DaysofGenerativeAI**

How do you Monetise Generative AI?

The current state of Generative AI exists because of the depth of engineering and capabilities of LLMs and Image generation models.But will they continue to reap the benefits?

The a16z report I was reading though makes an interesting point though – ‘Model providers invented generative AI, but haven’t reached large commercial scale’

**#1Closed** source models cannot maintain their edge indefinitely – Models released as open source can be hosted by anyone, including outside companies that don’t bear the costs associated with large-scale model training (that is very expensive). 

**#2Is** commercialization likely to be tied to hosting. 

“Demand for proprietary APIs (e.g. from OpenAI) is growing rapidly. Hosting services for open-source models (e.g. Hugging Face) are emerging as useful hubs to easily share and integrate models”

**#Integration** into use cases at the point of consumption

Example, ‘incorporation of generative AI into Internet search engines. Why? Because it might drive more people to a particular search engine’

Or Integration into existing product Portfolio such as what Microsoft is doing with Azure Open AI services

What is happening today?

“One approach consists of charging people a fee such as a monthly subscription or a per transaction charge when using generative AI. Whether people will be willing to pay for generative AI is still unknown. Some will, some won’t.”

What are the other ways this could pan out?

Product Placement embedded into Generative AI. This interesting Forbes article – Should generative AI such as ChatGPT make use of product placement ads? – which brings forth challenges around AI Ethics.

Bottomline, it is an ever evolving space – those who own a large portion of the tech stack and get the flywheel of engagement-value right will accrue benefits.

“I am 2 years into my first tech job and in a generalist role.

I see my peers in specialist roles such as software engineering or testing.

Should I be worried about losing out on depth of experience?”

Some young folks astound you.

Like this young 25 year old girl we spoke to recently in our mentoring session.

Incredibly self aware, she was playing multiple roles in her corporate role – from PM to Marketing and Program Management and was worried about whether she was in the right direction.

In today’s **#CoffeeChat**, [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I talk about about T and V shaped careers in Tech

And how you approach Generalist and Specialist roles.

[Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I share a passion for mentoring mid management folks to scale into leadership roles. Find time to chat with us here

My obsession with **#GenerativeAI** is selfish

To enable my 7 year old, to not just survive, but to thrive in a world very different from the one I grew up in.

The below chart (authored by [Sequoia Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) in Sept’22) “illustrates a timeline for how we might expect to see fundamental models progress and the associated applications that become possible.

2025 and beyond is just a guess.”

Like [Dharmesh Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) once said, AI moves in dog years.

**#Day3of30** **#30DaysofGenerativeAI**

What is the Future of Generative AI Products?

Products and AI – are two of my absolutely favourite areas.

So what forms would Generative AI products take?

Generative AI products take a number of different forms says a a16z article – from desktop apps, mobile apps, Figma/Photoshop plugins, Chrome extensions, even Discord bots.

There are two ways to think about where the products will come from :

☝ Stand alone companies – (Mid journey?)

✌ Super Charged AI Products through incumbents integrating it into their product lines ( Think about what [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is already doing with AI powered Bing through Search and product discovery.

Or what [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) could do through personalising curated feeds)

Why? It is easy to “integrate AI products where users already work, since the UI is generally just a text box”

Let think through the [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) example.

Why is AI enabled customisation such a brilliant use case –

In a [WIRED](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) video, Dartmouth college professor Chandrasekhar Ramanathan has been tasked to explain the concept of quantum sensing to 5 different people; a child, a teen, a college student, a grad student, and an expert.

Think about doing that with the AI – ‘if you’re explaining why it rains, you’ll use different language for an eight-year-old than for a high school student’

Coming back to an analogy of personalisation on a product I use daily – [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

I was wondering what a user persona story would an AI enabled personalised feed look like –

‘As an user, based on my unique profile \[Engagement + Experience + Interests…\], the feed would explain (curate) content on the same topics but with complexity as relevant to my profile”

That could imply the difference between explaining “habit forming” as a concept by Robin Sharma’s 5 AM club vs Nir Eyal’s Indistractable.

For the record, I prefer the latter.

While this is such an early (and evolving) space – I am hugely excited about how “this technology will impact how we work, learn, create, and play”

Stay tuned to follow along the **#30daysofGenerativeAI** to understand not just the tech but the strategic outlook to the GenerativeAI market.

**#Day2**/30 **#30daysofGenerativeAI**

What does the tech stack look like and where will value accrue?

3 points.

**#1What** is exciting vs valuable: Today most of the posts on our feed talks about the models and the apps – ie. the customer facing layer.

Why? because it is exciting right now. But that is the most undifferentiated part of it – and potentially not the one where most value would accrue.

But like most things, understanding the tech stack helps us understand why companies like [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) are looking at this from a end to end strategic perspective.

**#2The** end to end tech stack

I quite love this a16z article that shares this view – “The stack can be divided into three layers:

**Applications** that integrate generative AI models into a user-facing product, either running their own model pipelines (“end-to-end apps”) or relying on a third-party API

**Models** that power AI products, made available either as proprietary APIs or as open-source checkpoints (which, in turn, require a hosting solution)

**Infrastructure** vendors (i.e. cloud platforms and hardware manufacturers) that run training and inference workloads for generative AI models”

**#3Where** is the current value?

**As the article states, ‘infrastructure vendors** are likely the biggest winners in this market so far, capturing the majority of dollars flowing through the stack. 

**Application companies** are growing top-line revenues very quickly but often struggle with retention, product differentiation, and gross margins.

And most **model providers**, though responsible for the very existence of this market, haven’t yet achieved large commercial scale”

**As one might imagine, the differentiation and retention is more likely where one has depth.**

**Does them imply more of a verticalized market thereby giving a structural advantage to incumbents?**

**But both strategies – vertical and horizontal market expansions come with its own pros/cons – example, agility vs differentiation.**

**It sometimes feels like with Generative AI, the tech sector behaves like a kid in a candy shop**

Or in my case, a librarian with endless supply of books and time.

‘If you can’t find a spouse who supports your career, stay single’

An HBR article called out how**, “**Despite advances in gender equity, many professionally ambitious women still struggle to find balance between their career and that of their partner.

While these spouses are happy to have successful, high-earning wives, they are often caught off guard by trade-offs they were not expecting. 

All too often, they will applaud their wives’ ambitions — but only until those ambitions start to interfere with their own careers.

These wives’ disillusionment is deep and long-lasting, and it may be contributing to the increasing trend of “gray divorce:” 60% of divorces for older, decades-married couples are initiated by women, often leaving their husbands blindsided and heartbroken.

The lesson: Retaining women (whether at home or in the office) takes skill, self-awareness, and a real commitment to a future in which both members of a marriage get the chance to fulfill their potential”

There is a lot of gaslighting a woman goes through – constantly evaluating how much to push without necessarily coming across as ‘too ambitious’

So Valentines’, here is a reminder that whilst all the love-fuelled drama is nice, what really matters is how unconditionally supportive your spouse is of your career.

Who you marry is the single most important thing that defines where one lands up and what one does.

Choose wisely.

Good grades often lead to mediocrity in real life.

Parents want their kids to be the valedictorians – be top of the year since they are expected to do well in life.

In the book I am currently reading, “**Barking up the wrong tree**” the author, Eric questions the assumption.

In reality, that’s rarely the case, he says.

“Eric cites a study by Boston College, which tracked 81 valedictorians after their graduation in 1981\. 15 years later, they worked hard and learned a lot, but not a single one changed the world in earth-shattering ways.

Contrast that with the surprisingly large number of college dropouts on the Forbes 400 list, and an idea starts to emerge: maybe being good in school doesn’t matter so much, after all.”

Why is that, one would ask?

Doing well academically proves one thing: you’re good at following rules.

He says that, ‘Valedictorians typically settle into the system instead of shaking it up.’

“Schools reward being a generalist.

There is little recognition of student passion or expertise. The real world does the reverse.

They’re extremely well rounded and successful, personally and professionally, but they’ve never been devoted to a single area in which they put all their passion. That is not usually a recipe for eminence.”

Following the rules doesn’t create success; it just eliminates extremes—both good and bad. While this is usually good and all but eliminates downside risk, it also frequently eliminates earthshaking accomplishments.

So does it mean you don’t focus academically – I don’t think that is the point – the key is, being average is over.

True excellence and greatness (not just being good enough) comes from a mix of creativity, passion, obsession, vision, and commitment.

Personally, as the class topper, I can relate to what he states – something I struggle with with my daughter – between conforming to the rules/score good grades and letting her pursue her creativity.

Like she once asked me, ‘I don’t like it. Why should I only colour within the lines, Amma?’

How much do grades predict real world success?

What are your class toppers doing today?

Pic – The least ‘nerdiest’ thing I have ever done 🙂

How much of your pain is self inflicted?

I struggle with public speaking.

There are too many thoughts vying for attention in my head that I want to share. It took me a week’s practice to get my TEDx talk right – whilst it took my husband a few hours.

Failing terrifies me. With sleepless nights – failing at something at work, missing my morning routine, being a bad mom, not being productive, missing my goals, messing up my health routine…..

Chatting with my mentor made me realise how much of this is self-inflicted.

That stems from wanting to never fail, to be the shiny example and wanting to please everyone.

And that is why this quote by [Steven Bartlett](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is on the money

“Successful people have mental health issues, bad habits, gaps in their knowledge moments of self doubt, procrastination issues, imperfect routines

Insecurities and imposter syndrome too.

But they also know that all of these things are perfectly normal. 

That is the difference”

Steven Bartlett

Have you paused to think about how much of your mental pain is self inflicted?

One of these pieces is AI generated. And the other, human.  
  
Will AI replace writing?  
A long time ago, a person reached out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) with a compelling proposition  
  
‘You seem to write regularly on LinkedIn, have a full time job and are a parent. You must find it hard to find time’, he sympathised  
  
‘That true. But you tend to find time to do what you are passionate about’, I replied.  
  
‘We are starting an agency that ghost writes for folks. We analysed your content and wrote posts for you around tech – a topic you write a lot about,’ he offered.  
  
At first glance, to his due credit, it was factually well written content. What troubled me was not just outsourcing an area of passion – but more-so the fact that, the writing didn’t seem to be ‘me’.  
  
People have a signature over what they produce – include how they write.  
Over time, you can even recognise if your friend isn’t the one chatting with you.  
  
That is what makes writing unique – not just stringing together a set of words but evoking an emotion.  
  
And that explains why I am largely positive about how [#generativeAI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=generativeai&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7029753044170924032), if used well, will not just be net positive in helping our kids learn but also complement human force.  
  
Not replace it.  
  
Here is [🇺🇦 Eddie Shleyner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAgt0aUB9WFTLInmf0DGeZprFtq-pKk5WgI)‘s very topical example –

Microsoft unveils new Bing, Edge browser backed by upgraded OpenAI language model

[Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) yesterday announced the new AI powered browser – prompting me to try it for the first time ever 😉

“We’ve updated the Edge browser with new AI capabilities and a new look, and we’ve added two new functionalities: Chat and compose.

With the Edge Sidebar, you can ask for a summary of a lengthy financial report to get the key takeaways – and then use the chat function to ask for a comparison to a competing company’s financials and automatically put it in a table.

You can also ask Edge to help you compose content, such as a LinkedIn post, by giving it a few prompts to get you started. After that, you can ask it to help you update the tone, format and length of the post. Edge can understand the web page you’re on and adapts accordingly.”

I quite like the side-bar functionality – extremely intuitive and I can imagine the huge productivity gains it adds.

Imagine writing a LinkedIn post and working on improving the tone.

Maybe [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) wont have to ask me to review the tone of his posts anymore 🙂

Where will AI outperform (replace) humans?

OR Why AI models will replace artists long before they’ll replace programmers

I get various versions of this question.

While the field is so rapidly moving, making it almost impossible to predict – here is an interesting take (article in comments)

“Contrary to the common view that creativity will be the last bastion of human ingenuity in the face of automation, it actually appears to be far easier to automate rather difficult creative tasks than to automate relatively simple programming tasks.

To get a sense of this say we compare two popular use cases for generative AI: code generation and image generation. 

..In its current form, AI can make coding somewhat more efficient, it doesn’t obviate the need for capable software developers with programming knowledge.

One big reason is that, when it comes to building a program, correctness really matters. If AI generates a program, it still requires a human to verify it is correct — an effort at nearly the same level as creating it to begin with.

On the other hand, anyone who can type can use a model like Stable Diffusion to produce high-quality, one-of-a-kind images in minutes, at many orders of magnitude less cost.

Creative work products often do not have strict correctness constraints, and the outputs of the models are stunningly complete”

“Who knows: One day, a late-2022 archive of the internet may be treasured as one of the last mostly human-generated content repositories”

What areas do you think AI will replace?

Transitioning from an IC into a people manager?

Here are 5 pointers to succeed

The first time I became a people manager, the area I struggled with the most is in having difficult conversations

Over time you realise that not being candid with feedback around performance is doing disservice to the individual and the larger team

On Episode 7 of **#CoffeeChats**, [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I talk about what you need to keep in mind when moving into a people management role.

What was your first experience as a people leader?

Why do so many girls top their classes at school and college and yet so few remain in the workforce a decade later?

What results in women dropping out of the workforce before they reach management positions – especially in Tech/STEM?

A McKinsey report shared a concept called the “broken rung”

“Yet even as more women reach senior management, too many are still getting stuck in entry-level jobs—”the broken rung” phenomenon.

Top-level female execs may be cracking the glass ceiling, but overall women are less likely to be promoted to or hired for leadership roles. With 72 women promoted to management for every 100 men, and men holding 62 percent of manager-level jobs…”

The WEF Global Gender Gap report 2020 states that the share of Women in Data and AI roles is at 32%.

A figure that likely drops further when you look at leadership in tech.

There is no single reason why this happens.

I am privileged to be part of organisations that considers diversity as not just the right thing to do but one that heralds us into a better future even from a business perspective.

I have heard so many views (and strong opinions) shared around this.

Change starts with our perspectives at home and at schools – in how we raise kids, roles we attribute to each family member and how we provide them opportunities and a solid support system.

All that I ask for are equal (not more) opportunities (and support) – Irrespective of who you are.

For everyone deserves a chance.

Nothing more. Nothing less.

What initiatives do you think can help increase girls’ participation in STEM?

Can Food Waste be a preventable problem?

What if one could increase the shelf life of vegetables and fruits we consume?

How much of economic waste would that help tackle?

[GreenPod Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) states that 40% of the vegetables and fruits are lost due to spoilage/over ripening.

As an Agri-biotech company they are working on sustainable solutions to minimise agricultural food waste in India.

How?

Through patented active packaging tech that can extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables.

The product comprises natural plant extracts that can activate a defense mechanism within a fruit or vegetable to slow down the ripening rate and minimize the microbial attack at ambient temperatures

The product has been tested by NABL certified labs to prove there is zero residue of the product on the crop after use and doesn’t impact the nutrition in any negative form. T

The company is working with more than 25+ customers to run product trials and validations for the last 6 months.

I have been quite attracted towards startups working on sustainability and clean tech.

So I read this Blake Frost’ Sci-Fi book over last weekend

It made me deeply uncomfortable – like most good stories that border on reality do

Black Mirror-esque, it explores man’s relationship with AI, ethics of ‘what is right’, sentience and free will.

A rudimentary AI that expands on a set of progressions, its relationship with its creator-developer, what it means for it to take a human form or go past singularity and sentience.

The state (and growth) of AI today feels much like the more you learn, the less you seem to know.

Fan of Sci-Fi as a genre? Check out the Blake Frost’s Summer Frost

How have your priorities changed over the last 10 years?

We overestimate what we can do in a day and

Underestimate what we can do over a year

When I started my first job with [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) nearly 15 years ago, my focus was, unabashedly, the financial freedom it offered.

Down the line, I went through the rabbit hole of ‘how do I grow in my career’ and ‘am I learning?’

Over the last couple of years, the flexibility of time, learning and leveraging tech for good are bigger motivators

Whilst a part of the world is moving rapidly with exponentially growing tech, there is another – who is playing catch up.

Tech to me is the greatest leveller.

You never know whom you can reach or impact – in your own tiny way.

And thus, it is gratitude notes such as these that make it so fulfilling to write on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

How have you transformed over the last decade?

What happens when the future of the tech arrives?

Across Singularity, Super-intelligence and Sentience, Inter-Galactic travel, Genetic Engineering to Quantum Computing?

That is the thought experiment this Sci-Fi series – Forward Collection sets out to explore

“Take a leap. For some, it’s the end of the world.

For others, it’s just the beginning.

With brilliant imagination, today’s most visionary writers point to the future in a collection curated by bestselling author Blake Crouch. These stories range from darkly comic to deeply chilling, but they all look forward.”

Some of the finest authors come together to pen this short stories collection that is released as a series of 6 books.

I think the ones I enjoyed the most is Summer Frost and Emergency Skin

How does Data Science help in building products in a startup?

A 101 guide

On my journey back home from my vacation, I met a tech startup founder who asked ‘what is the role of data science in building products’?

While it is easy for folks to conflate AI and data science in terms of model building, in essence, DS ‘reduces uncertainty’ and allows a company to compete through understanding the vast unstructured data across multiple data sources

Sequoia did a great write-up on Data informed Product building highlighting the below 4 outcomes

**#1Evaluating** the health of the business : Defining, monitoring, measuring and understanding product health, drivers and variations

**#2Shipping** the right products and features : DS helps drive multiple experiments to guide product teams on optimizing for the product based on insights and ensuring the right features get built

**#3Forecast** Outcomes with Prototypes/ Production ML models : Support forecasting future expectations and trends with AI/ML. Ex – think identifying fraudulent activity using production systems

**#4Drive** Product Roadmap and Strategy : Understand user behavior and journey to help set roadmap and strategy

Data informed decision making for startups in building products can be a huge competitive advantage and a differentiator, if set up correctly.

Are you effectively leveraging datascience in your startup for data informed product building?

If you are a start-up seeking to understand how to leverage AI/ML, would love to hear from you

How do you make a career pivot?

I have x years of experience but I want to switch into a career in data science.

I want to move from program to product management.

One of the top most questions [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I get during the mentoring sessions is around how to make a career shift

Whilst most of them think of it as a linear path from A to B – it is hardly as simple as that.

Its something I have thought about and experimented on oft, including with people who have moved into my team in the past from a very different field

Here are some pointers to get you started if you are considering shifting gears

The startup that creates Carbon tiles out of Polluted Air

Gurgaon’s air quality index today is 387 AQI.

The ideal range for human life quality is between 0-50.

Is that the inheritance we want to leave our children with?

As part of my **#TheGoodFund** research of socially impactful tech start-ups, I recently stumbled upon the Clean-tech startup, [CarbonCraft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)

The founder, [Tejas Sidnal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), “was keen to create an architectural intervention to up-cycle pollution, one that can be achieved through technology and craft”

“The startup, which was officially founded in January 2019, is working in collaboration with Air-Ink, a Boston-based startup that is processing the air pollutants and providing them with the soot to use in their innovation”

The soot is infused with materials like marble chips, marble powder, cement along with a proprietary binder

An article state that, ‘Handmade by traditional craftsmen, each one of these carbon tiles equals cleaning 30,000 litres of polluted air. That’s one full day’s worth of clean air per person!”

Beyond everything else, what appealed to me was their story and the fundamental question all of us should ask ourselves –

“Everything in nature has a functional purpose and there is no wastage. Then why do humans have so much waste?

“Using air pollution as a resource in the model of a circular economy just as everything in the forest comes a full circle; that was the philosophy that led to their start-up”

Know of a tech startup driving social impact, especially backed by women? drop me a note or tag them here 🙂

A #101Guide to why is everyone so excited about Generative AI and #ChatGPT? 

  
Like most, I have been obsessing over #ChatGPT.

  
Lets learn more about why the hype in 5 based on a lovely article that I will link in comments

  
#1 Is this already in use? Generative AI has been around for a while now – Grammarly, for example, already puts generative AI into use

  
#2 Why the hype now and how is it different from other ML based recommendations and models used earlier? 

  
This begs the question about why we use machines and in what aspects are they better than us? There are three areas one could look at around judging that – 

1\. Perception

2\. Optimization

3\. Cognition

  
Example of perception is a facial recognition algorithm that can ‘extract patterns very quickly’

  
Optimization refers to the ability of an algorithm to assess multiple options (quickly) to arrive at decisions – ex. crunching data to identify the most optimal route

  
An area that AI has struggle (and still does to a large extent) is the third one – Cognition – ‘ to be able to make sense of things and understand them in context’.

  
Something that stands in stark contrast, when my then 5 year old understood context better than my Google Home device.

  
And that is what we have started to impact with Generative AI – to not just ‘understand the language, but the story’.

  
And that is the difference between searching keywords in an engine vs asking a question on ChatGPT

  
#3 Can you talk layman language and tell me what it implies? 

I’d highly recommend the book – ‘The Moon is a Harsh Mistress’ by Robert Heinlein because it probes this topic further through Sci-Fi. As ‘Mike’ the AI that has ‘come alive’ and its implications to society

  
#4 How does Generative AI work?

“Generative AI is an umbrella term for a number of ML methods — including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)”

Most ML algorithms used mainstream today are ‘discriminative’ – 

1) Recommendation Systems : Things similar to what you have purchased

2) Classification : This is an image of a cat

3) Clustering : Here are 5 tweets about Obama

  
And this is based on input data that it is trained on.

Generative AI, can create data leveraging what it pays ‘attention’ to amongst other things, thereby creating closer to ‘human-quality’ output.

  
#5 What should we be wary about?

For all the hype, the tech is still early stage. There are umpteen challenges associated with it as well around security (deep fakes), data privacy to copyright issues.

More interestingly, the ethical implications of the tech.

  
The future though, is what we make of it 🙂

  
What are your thoughts on Generative AI?

What are the good questions to ask in a job interview?

Whilst we think of interviewing as a 1 way process, it is equally important for you to use the time to assess if you would be a good fit to the role and company

Also, a well researched question can tell you a lot about what isn’t in the JD.

And it sets you apart as a candidate that knows their stuff.

So next time you are interviewing do not miss using these tips!

My top 5 skills for tech professionals to keep up with developments in the sector

“By 2025, 44% of the skills that employees will need to perform their roles effectively will change’, states the WEF Future of Work report.

This morning, I read a [The Verge](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) report on 2023 Tech predictions that called out that “the use of ChatGPT in education will spark a national conversation about AI” – accelerated by the kids spreading this word of mouth.

We tend to think of change linearly whilst tech change happens exponentially.

I obsess over how the world around us changes and how to stay relevant – more for my kid than for myself.

I believe that technology has an intrinsic role to play across professions – making it crucial to have digital literacy – ‘skills that are essential to learn, work and navigate in the digital world’.

Here are my top 5 as we wrap up 2022.

**#1Programming**, Data and AI : These skills are already in high demand and will continue to do so. Even as we worry about AI taking over jobs, there are new ones being created – it is predicted that ’97 million jobs involving artificial intelligence (AI) will be created between 2022 and 2025′. Inspite of the influx of low-code and no code solutions, the need for complementary areas to bring in efficiencies will continue to exist in the near future.

**#2Cloud** Computing : The adoption of cloud computing, big data and e-commerce remain high priorities for business leaders. The demand for Cloud Engineers, DevOps engineers and Cloud Consultants continue to rise. With organizations continuing to move to the cloud globally, skillsets related to cloud technologies will be in demand.

**#3Product** Development and management :

Product management is one of the most sought-after careers in India today. There are over 20,000 product management jobs available for qualified personnel in India.

There is a proliferation of new roles in the area across product owners, analysts and digital product managers

**#4Creator** Economy and Social media management : “As of 2022, the creator economy market size is estimated at $104.2 billion, more than double its value since 2019”. This has spawned the need for low code tools, short form videos, micro-entrepreneurs disrupting traditional roles and new media across organizations.

**#5Digital** transformation, Growth and Digital Marketing : Digital Marketing and Strategy specialists and Digital transformation specialists are some of the top 10 roles that have seen increased demand as corroborated in the WEF report.

What do you think are the most valuable and in-demand skills you think professionals in tech should look at learning to stay relevant?

What is the best career advice you have got?

Schooling optimises for who knows and communicates the most.

And as someone who topped classes, that is what I learnt to do

I transitioned the mindset when I moved into my career – I had this inherent need to let people know all that I was doing.

When I was chatting with one of my mentors who was an SVP at the time, I asked him, ‘What is it that he did differently as he scaled up?’

Amongst other things, what he mentioned was exactly this – ‘Learning to communicate at the right altitude with the message tailored to the person’

The more removed the person is from you in terms of levels, the lesser they share context with you.

Translating your message into what it means to them ensures it lands at the right level.

Since that conversation, I oft reflect on how I do this myself and how I can now perceive it in conversations I have with others.

“I remember sitting in on an executive review where a Product Manager was talking about the recent launch of a major product.

As someone who worked far away from their team, I had a really hard time parsing what they were trying to say. I walked away confused and frustrated, because it was not clear to me who the product was for, or why we were working on it

Often, the difference between a good leader and a great one is altitude. Being able to navigate at the right level for the conversation, whether you’re doing a deep dive into the details with a colleague or discussing high-level strategy with executives, is a rare skill.

But it is also crucial to hone in order to be successful in the workplace”, says [Deborah Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) in her article linked below.

Are you ensuring your message lands at the right level with your audience?

Honing on that skill is worth its weight in gold

Since I cannot articulate this better, I’ll leave this here : https://debliu.substack.com/p/communicating-at-the-right-altitude

So stoked to be named as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) Top Voice in Technology and Innovation!  
  
I started writing on LinkedIn to learn and stay curious.  
  
Over the 2 years I have engaged here, I have met some wonderful people, got great opportunities and learnt so much from just being consistent.  
  
I write for the sheer love of it – and for my passion for tech – but I would be lying to say that I am not happy about the recognition.  
  
I grew up in a middle class family, with working parents who were both English literature graduates – fascinated with my love for STEM  
  
Thus, Tech for someone like me, was the ultimate leveller, providing me opportunities to be independent and to have a voice.  
When I couldn’t learn from my parents, I turned to books and then to mentors.  
  
I am hugely thankful to my leaders, mentors and everyone who has made space to help a stranger – something I hope to pay forth in my own teensy way.  
  
Thank you, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) – forever grateful!

‘How do you find a mentor’

That is one of the questions we oft get asked.

A majority of folks approach mentoring quite wrong – asking someone you hardly know, ‘Can you be my mentor’, has very low chances of working.

Mentors have played a crucial role across my career, putting me in rooms I didn’t belong and giving me a voice before I knew how to use mine.

And that happens by giving before you take.

In **#Episode3** of **#CoffeeChatswithVandR**, [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I cover how to go about finding one.

OpenAI recently upgraded its language model and it now writes rhyming poetry

The GPT3 powered AI large language models, text-davinci-003 ‘reportedly improves on its predecessors by handling more complex instructions and producing longer-form content’

As a user pointed out though, the models come with its own set of challenges that continue to be worked upon (for example, ‘It still can’t do addition for large numbers with naive prompts’)

But here is a rhyming poem that explains Einstein’s relativity ala John Keats style

What do you see is the future of language models and its impact on creative pursuits?

“I want to be very wealthy when I grow up”

Dad looked up, bemused and asked, “But why, ‘mole’?” (daughter, in Malayalam)

Wealth, according to my middle class, government salaried parents meant that it was most probably acquired by dubious means.

And as a culture, aspiration was meant for life’s higher ideals, not baser, material things.

And it was plain greedy to wish for more of something. Something someone has less of.

And yet, what I optimised for from life has changed from money I can earn, to impact I can drive, over the last few years.

Tech, and access to information, can be a great leveler.

What technology has driven today though is how wealth creation can be moral.

Yet, based on my recent trip to the rural farmlands, there is this huge lacuna that exists in leveraging tech for good.

The fresh produce from the foot-hills ranging from millets, luscious fruits such as guavas, noni to star-fruit lay wasted while the tribes that rear them struggle to make ends meet.

I have been researching agri-tech start-ups that connect farms directly to households, providing the tribal artisans a distribution channel to customers whilst giving customers access to the fresh produce.

I closest I come across is [myHarvest Farms](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) – a farm to home initiative by [Archana Stalin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Stalin Kalidoss](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) (Tip – I have issues adding items to the cart :))

I wonder if there is more that can be done in terms of on-boarding farmers, logistics support or potentially exploring subscription boxes.

If you know of Agri-tech startups playing in the space of farm to home – please DM.

My hope is, at some point in the future, to start a VC fund directed at **#StartupsforSocialImpact** – **#TheGoodFund**

Towards that, as I learn more, here is my weekly series to amplify the startups that are already paving inroads in this space

There are always fires to put out and a never ending list of things to get done.

Nothing is more frustrating than to sit in front of your laptop all day but feel like you haven’t accomplished anything.

Whilst days and months roll by.

A recent practice I have been adopting based on [Matt Mochary](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s framework inspired by Cal Newport’s book, ‘Deep Work’ is the ‘Top Goal Framework’

**“Schedule two hours each day to work on your Top Goal only. And do this every single workday. Period”**

“During this Top Goal time, do not respond to emails, texts, calls, and messages. Only work on your top priority during these two hours”

If 2 hours is too much, start with 30 mins.

I use a kanbanboard pomodoro to keep me on track.

Do you deep work?

I spent the weekend at a fruit orchard in the rural hinterlands

Reflecting on the experience, on the way back, here are a few perspectives –

1) The world as a ‘we’ know of it – the news we consume, the problems we discuss and trends we cover, is of the bubble we live in – making up maybe 10% of the Tier I – II towns and cities.

The population at large – especially in the rural hinterlands have their own worries – much like Maslow’s hierarchy, focussed on survival.

2) Lack of diversity oft manifests itself as lack of individuality – A large part of the societal fabric is treated as just that – background – scurrying around getting things done to keep the ebb flowing.

I was in a room with an elderly relative who was discussing property rates. Despite me asking pointed questions around it, he continued to respond only to the other male in the room – this, albeit the fact that I earn 10x or manage investments for my family.

Feeling unheard is debilitating. Breaking barriers takes generations.

3) Extreme Wealth disparity – The extreme wealth of folks in the agricultural hinterlands astounds me. More so, because it doesn’t percolate down to the grass roots.

I am genuinely interested in figuring out how to help – if you work in/know of DTC brands in agri-tech, please DM.

A lot of gratitude and a lot of questions from a weekend well spent. Have you had similar experiences?

This story reflects so much that is true.

Taking a bet on yourself is hard. Maybe for all.

But definitely so for a woman

Especially if you are raised in a culture that values topping the classes and fearing failure.

I see this in how I function too – it is extremely hard for me to disappoint my parents – even today. It is a constant battle between what I want vs what my family needs.

Kudos to [Suneera Madhani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) for beating the odds.

Even today, less than 3% of VC funding is directed at women led startups

Representative matters – maybe my daughter would be braver than I am 🙂

Ask better questions

“How do I get into analytics?” “What should I do next?”

I get a lot of such questions during my mentoring sessions.

Unless one knows you personally, these are questions that don’t yield much value.

These are what Reid Hoffman called ‘Blue Sky questions’.

“What are the skills you gauge in business analysts you hire fresh out of college”

” I am in project management and switching to product – these are the risks that I see that I am working towards – what else would you recommend I should be looking into?”

They are specific. They are areas a mentor can add value. They show you have done your homework and separate you from the rest.

Learning to ask better questions. It’s a skill that pays off across your career.

Do you have other under rated skills that you recommend?

I have an extremely visceral reaction to food that is wasted.

My grandmother was widowed at a very young age with around 9 kids between 23 to 2

With a meagre monthly pension to support her, she indexed on making sure her kids were educated. She was deeply intelligent and ensured that every resource at her disposal went all the way.

Since our parents had full time jobs, she raised my brother and I. And a non-negotiable was waste. Zero waste was a concept she followed even before it was made fancy.

[Nikhil Bohra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) led agritech, [Krimanshi](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) works on upcycling food waste into low cost, high quality, nutritious cattle feed and fodder.

Around 1.3Bn tonnes of food each year gets wasted, reports the Food and Agriculture Organization. Food losses and waste amounts to roughly $310 bn in developing countries.

Much of the agri waste, \~ 31 crore tons, is burnt while another 10 crore tons of grains, fruits and vegetables are lost due to poor storage and logistics. This is where a great business opportunity lies for startups such as Krimanshi.

The Jodhpur based startup leverages tech to ‘upcycles food waste collected from farms, produce markets and other sources and dehydrates them in a controlled environment…’ into low cost cattle feed.

“The primary beneficiaries of this social enterprise today include, low-income, dairy farmers who cannot, otherwise, afford high-protein dairy feed, and therefore are unable to sustain profitable milk production”

As I learn more about tech startups driving social impact, I realize that there are hardly any with women founders 🙂

Why do folks not respond to cold DMs?

Cold DM 101

You want to reach out to someone you don’t know. Maybe you seek a referral, mentoring or want to learn more about their journey.

You type Hi and wait for a response.

And get radio silence.

Lets deconstruct how you can engage better with folks on social media

1) Say what you or want or seek : We treat inboxes like visits to a stranger’s house – akin to knocking on the door and waiting for a response. It doesn’t work that way.

Unless you know the person, rarely will a stranger response to random Hi messages.

Provide a short intro and ask what you seek along with why.

2) Engage with the person : A person accepted your invite and you immediately bombard them with a sales pitch. This must be Sales 101 – I can’t think of one reason when this will result in a conversion. Seek to engage with the person or their posts first.

3) Apply Second Order Thinking : Ask yourself – ‘“And then what?”

“Can you help me?” questions sans context are not helpful – especially from a stranger. Please do your homework – ask specific questions.

Connecting with people on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and learning from them is the biggest joy and reason I write here daily.

I have met some wonderful folks here – doing just that – with cold DMs. Make them work for you 🙂

Any tips that worked for you?

Career Chats with Ranjani and Vignesh

[Vignesh](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I share very few interests – one of it is mentoring 🙂

We talk a lot about common themes that we hear during our respective sessions.

A lot of those questions are relevant to a larger audience – how do I get promoted, pursuing passion areas, conflict management etc

So starting this week, we will focus on sharing a short weekly video on common themes we hear.

On Episode 1 – ‘How do you manage stakeholders’

This is hugely relevant in analytics – and a gap I constantly see. But also in strategy and operations. Here is a short video with our top 5 pointers around managing stakeholders

Why do fresh produce at source cost 1/10 the prices we pay in cities?

We spend our summer vacations at our uncle’s farm in a rural village in the South of India. A lot of farmers worked the lands, for what seemed to me, like meagre returns.

Their teenage girls, as young as myself at the time, were already married.

‘Well, I need to hand over the burden to someone else no ma’, said the gap toothed farmer, smilingly, when I asked him about it.

With the penetration of mobile internet, leapfrogging tech access to rural populations, agritech raised 1.6B funds in 2021-22\. Yet, it is still in its infancy at 1.5% penetration says a [Kalaari Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) report.

**#DeHaat** is one of the fastest-growing Agri-tech start-ups founded in 2012 by [Shashank Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

It offers end-to-end agricultural services to the Indian farmers – ‘ full-stack agricultural services to farmers, including distribution of seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, farm machinery, cattle feed and all agriculture allied products, farm advisory, financial services and market linkages to sell farm produce’.

Most of all, what appealed to me about DeHaat’s story was that of earning the trust of farmers and the need to help fix the broken agri processes with technology – a key use case of tech for good.

The big learning, he says, is empathy. “You’re talking about someone who is feeding everyone but is starving himself”

Currently they boast of 1 million+ farmers in their service network with a goal is to bring their services to 5 million farmers by 2024.

Technology is the biggest leveller – it should be as much to those who need it the most too – the ones’ who put food on our plates.

As I learn more about tech startups driving social impact, I realize that there are hardly any with women founders 🙂

Turning discarded temple flowers into incense and vegan leather, whilst providing hundreds of jobs for local women

My grand mom was quite a religious woman.

On days like Diwali or Krishna Janmastami, her house came alive in colors.

With orange and yellow marigolds at every door and jasmine in threads in everyones’ hair.

But then, flowers adorned on gods couldn’t be disposed away in trash. So she sent my brother and I away the following day, to drop the withered flowers at the temple or at the well nearby.

Now think about that at scale on the shores of what is considered one of the most revered rivers in the world – The Ganges.

Phool.co is an Indian biomaterials startup co-founded by [Ankit Agarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Prateek Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) in 2017 to recycle temple flower waste dumped in rivers in Kanpur, a city in the north of India.

“The idea of further using wasted flowers seemed ludicrous. We had to toil to convey our idea of recycling the temple waste because nobody was willing to take it seriously or give up their floral waste.

A year and a half and countless hours in a makeshift laboratory later, flowercycled incense was conceived and crafted. The mission to preserve the river Ganges and empower vernacular people by providing a means to earn their livelihood became a reality”

There are 70 days left to end the year. Are there goals you are yet to achieve?

Boxing is something I hugely enjoyed as part of my fitness goals. Especially when it was against the spouse 🙂

Thanks to the excessive lifting though, I had an abdominal hernia and then COVID happened, throwing a spanner in the works

Since I trust processes drive results – here is mine for the rest of the year

Start interval training with sprints at 6.45 AM each day for 30 mins. A lesser extreme version of Tabata. Targeted at reducing the fat % from an ‘acceptable’ 26% to a ‘fit’ 20-24%

Thats it.

Do you have a daily goal you want to follow for the remaining 70 days? Drop a comment to hold yourself accountable!

‘How to build a happy life’ is a recent podcast find that I am loving!

“In our pursuit of a happy life, we build, we structure, and we plan. Often, we follow conventional wisdom and strategize.

But what happens when our plans fall through and expectations don’t meet reality—when the things that should make us happy don’t?”

That is the question that it seeks to answer – ‘with data-driven insights and a healthy dose of introspection’

From finding the secret to meaningful work, to identify what you enjoy…

What are the podcasts that you recommend? Across Tech, career or being better?

“The AI software told banks to deny millions of legitimate purchases, at a time when consumers had been scrambling for toilet paper and other essentials.

The company said a global group of 20 analysts who constantly monitor its systems recommended temporary adjustments that avoided a blockade on spending.

The team is automatically alerted to unusual buying activity that could confuse the AI, relied on by 9,000 financial institutions overall to detect fraud across 2 billion cards”

The use-case brings to forefront the need for AI monitoring – a growing market with ML Ops to ‘catch AI drift’

McKinsey & Co found that most organizations surveyed are not regularly monitoring AI-based programs after launching them.

Reminds me of a review a long time ago, when I presented a paper titled, ‘AI is not magic’ 🙂

Have you come across situations when AI is sought out as a ‘catch-all’ to solve problems?

What makes you passionate?

I was chatting with this newly minted CEO of a heath tech start up over the weekend.

He had, in the past, played executive roles and had moved onto investment and consulting.

His new startup leverages AI to automate manual work in healthcare and clinical trials. He spoke in depth about the leveraging tech for good and the impact to patients and clinicians.

I smiled at his enthusiasm and asked, ‘So, do you have a background or degree in biosciences?’

He grinned and stated, ‘Not really. I can get passionate about things I want to learn very quickly’.

That, I believe is an essential trait of those who do exceptionally well at their careers – being able to self learn.

In this age, where there is no dearth of information, context or reach -having the focus to be an autodidact –   **person who teaches himself or herself, rather than being taught by a teacher, is the ultimate super power.**

What have you learnt by yourself in the last 6 months?

UNICEF estimated 44,000 Indian women die annually due to preventable childbirth-related causes.

I had an extremely high risk pregnancy.

Weeks ahead of my due date, I woke up with a splitting headache and the blood pressure monitor threw up an error.

My husband insisted on visiting the hospital before going to work.

So I did – walking into the doctors’ office with my laptop bag in hand.

That probably saved my life.

My blood pressure was so extremely out of range that the doctor was surprised I wasn’t hallucinating. She rushed me to an ICU and I got progressively worse within a day.

The doctors warned us of multiple organ failure if I waited any longer to deliver – I fought back wanting to give my kid a fighting chance.

Long story short, it’s a miracle we both made it out ok.

I know the story wouldn’t have ended this way if I didn’t have the medical support that I did.

Something that may not be the case for thousands of women across India who don’t have access to the knowledge or the means to monitor high risk pregnancies.

So today as part of **#TheGoodFund**‘s showcase of tech startups with social impact, I want to feature, [Janitri](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), a Bangalore based biotech firm that is building affordable and easy-to-use wearable and AI-enabled solutions to bridge this gap.

Founded by [Arun Agarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), whose fledgling startup is looking to “monitor the critical vital parameters of the expectant mother, fetus, and newborn at the right time and an early decision can be taken, we can prevent millions of life-long complications and deaths happening during the phase of pregnancy, delivery, and post-delivery”

“In the next 2 years, we will be scaling up and touching millions of mothers and newborns lives during pregnancy, delivery, and post-delivery.”

Having a close brush with death can be life changing – but I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

No one should have to lose their mother on a preventable birth related health complication.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

“For twenty years, the company ran mentorship programs, identified and promoted talented women early and often, and offered numerous trainings. And yet the only women in the C-suite were in marketing and HR, both pivotal but non-P&L roles. Why? “

\*\*A new study of 21 female CEOs by Korn Ferry. Experts say that the systemic change necessary to consistently feed C-suites with diverse candidates has not yet happened.

\*\*At most companies, future CEOs need to be in sequenced global rotations across P&L leadership and key enterprise roles starting 10 to 15 years before they enter the C-suite. These key roles, especially broad general-management jobs, are often skipped over—leading to the “superstar capabilities but lacking experienced candidates” problem.

There are a lot of things in this article that struck me

– How we tend to focus on getting women back to work but little on building and sustaining a pipeline to leadership : key being that executive roles require a pipeline starting 10-15 years before they move into C suite

– What also struck me is the research around fewer women wanting to be leaders. I wonder how much of this is driven by our societal norms. While I personally have been hugely ambitious – I have had the support and backing of my family. I wonder if it might have been different if that was at odds.

What do you think holds women back from leadership positions, especially in P&L roles?

Over and over I have seen two key reasons why analytics projects fail

**#1Business** Context – AI strategy needs to align with Business Strategy.

Not as a hammer in search of a nail.

A long time ago, we attempted building out NLP models with text data – we tried it all, from Word2Vec to Google BERT.

Business SME inputs oft helped us look at the right data and ask the right questions. Don’t build in silos.

If you want to increase the success of your applied data science problems, work in tandem with a business SME

Insights don’t drive impact – actions do.

**#2Focus** as much on the consumption of AI as the production of AI

We oft think about all the fancy ways in which we can produce predictions – rarely about how the insights will be consumed or if it aligns with what success means to the business

When you scope out a project, remember to ask, ‘so what’.

So what if you provide this – what happens then? Is it integrated in the last mile, do you have alignment from users on how it will be adopted?

Actions drive business impact – not just insights.

And if you are a data scientist who can think outcomes instead of output, you are immensely valuable.

Do you have experiences on winning with AI?

The Promise is a 2021 Booker prize winner

A story of a dysfunctional White South African family

And its disintegration over time

Of a promise made to their Black maid that takes 30 years to acknowledge

That weaves together the narrative of the changing political system underlying it

“Galgut depicts a family that has no close links with each other, Amor cannot stomach her morally bankrupt and lost family, squandering their opportunities and dreams, the marital infidelities, the humiliations, the drinking, and the self deceptions.

She refuses to benefit financially and makes no attempt to keep in touch. Religion, including the New Age aspects, is portrayed as ambitious, hypocritical, overly judgemental, power hungry and sinning.

The fragile and tenuous connections between the family is reflected in the threads holding South Africa together, from the hope displayed at the Rugby World Cup, to the deep fractures, the rising crime, and the compromised integrity in the years that follow.”

I oft pause to draw parallels to the political and caste systems that I am more familiar with and smile

For hegemony is a truth that seems as universal as time

It isn’t an easy read. Albeit a powerful one.

“Waiting in respectful silence is an essential part of the job and he has developed the capacity to simulate deep calm while experiencing none of it. In his core, Mervyn Glass is a frantic man.”

I have been researching Startups in Tech driving Social Impact

Potentially backed by Women in Tech

It brings together all that I am passionate about

– Live your potential, no matter where you are

– And Leveraging Tech for Good to Drive Social Impact

My hope is, at some point in the future, to start a VC fund directed at **#StartupsforSocialImpact** – **#TheGoodFund**

Towards that, as I learn more, here is my weekly series to amplify the startups that are already paving inroads in this space

[Geetha Manjunath](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is the CEO of Niramai, the Bangalore-based deep-tech startup addressing critical healthcare problems through automated solutions.

Their mission is to create a Universal Cancer Screening Method that can save lives.

NIRAMAI Health Analytix is a Bangalore-based deep-tech startup addressing critical healthcare problems through automated solutions.

“One of the most common method to diagnose the earliest signs of cancer is Thermography.

However, interpreting a thermal image can be error prone as there are about 4,00,000 colour points for every person.

Niramai offers solutions which enables automated analysis and in better interpretation of thermal images, using AI.

Niramai or ‘Non-Invasive Risk Assessment with Machine Intelligence’ has developed an early breast cancer detection technology that is a radiation-free and non-invasive. 

Maybe someday I can sit with [Geetha Manjunath](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) to learn her story behind why she started Niramai.

Are you indispensable at work?

There is a village in China – outside of Shenzen called Dafen.

It is said that 60% of new oil paintings worldwide was produced here.

The workers in Dafen – while diligent and talented aren’t artists – they are painters.

Cogs in a painting machine.

The author, Seth Godin, talks about 2 paintings he owns from Dafen for 60 USD each.

Who knows which Dafen resident painted them – no one.

Who cares – no one.

The painters are replaceable.

This is becoming more essential in order to survive in the workplace

Because the days of being a cog in the wheel are over

“The job is what you do when you are told what to do. The job is showing up at the factory, following instructions, meeting spec, and being managed.

Someone can always do your job a little better or faster or cheaper than you can.

The job might be difficult, it might require skill, but it’s a job.

Your art is what you do when no one can tell you exactly how to do it. Your art is the act of taking personal responsibility, challenging the status quo, and changing people”

Be an artist. Not a painter.

What do you do when people you manage fail?

1) You forgive and forget

2) You remember, pass blame, stigmatise and humiliate them

3) You forgive and remember

The right approach that Bob Sutton, a Professor of Management at Stanford University advocates is to

– forgive so that people have psychological safety and

– remember, so that you can learn, the person can learn and the organisation can learn

There can be no innovation or learning without failure.

‘Failure sucks but Instructs’

The first thing that struck me when I spoke to [Ajeya Motaganahalli](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) was his sense of focus on setting up a culture and process that drives performance vs a purely results oriented mindset.

The leaders who you have loved working with have mostly been the one’s who had your back.

And [Ajeya Motaganahalli](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) comes across as exactly that – a leader one wants to work for. One I would always look up to.

Join us tomorrow in **#Episode4** of PIVOT **#LeaderTalks** to deconstruct how you set up and scale high performing teams. And how you can set up a culture devoid of fear.

PIVOT **#Leadertalks** works towards my personal goal to help Scale Women in AI and Product Leadership.

Just because you can doesn’t mean you should

AI is evolving. And it is painting nails.

My cousin who is on Instagram recently showed me a video of a robot manicurist

An AI based system that uses ‘sophisticated algorithms which determine how the nozzle should move to deposit nail polish in the right places”

Again, I say this as an observation and not a judgement – as we develop AI systems, where should we use them?

To make more accurate nail painting or better french fries?

Watching Shark Tank, I oft wonder how the seemingly ridiculous contraptions pick up million USD cheques.

Maybe the middle class upbringing doesn’t let me comprehend why one would spend 20 USD on a beer can that doubles up as a fishing rod.

Nonetheless, money, tends to flow where there is demand.

And as long as there are customers willing to pay, there are always going to be products to cater to them – whimsical as it may sound.

Which is probably why the new slew of entrepreneurs building for social impact makes me so happy.

Maybe, some day, if I become a VC – I would fund entrepreneurs in Web3 who build to democratize tech and drive social impact.

For the world doesn’t have to be zero sum game.

This person doesn’t exist.

This image is created by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

– essentially one that generates ‘hyperrealistic fake images of people who do not exist’

While I believe AI can be used for good, it is also hugely crucial we understand and are informed about how the tech can be as dangerously misused as it is fascinating.

Also, it doesn’t fail to strike me as to how none of the 25+ odd iterations I tried created a single person who looks similar someone like me.

Reiterating how it is as easy to pass on human biases to machines 🙂

What is the single most important thing to start your work day?

No, not with emails.

Take 15 mins to plan out your calendar for the day.

Here are three things to make sure you account for on your calendar

**#1Do** you have Deep Work slotted into the calendar to tackle the top 1-3 things you want to do for the day. Even if the rest of the day is off track, you can go to bed with a sense of achievement for the day.

**#2Can** you time-chunk tasks? : That means, slot in time to check emails and slack twice a day. You should own the notifications, not the other way around

**#3** Reduce Context Switching : Try to cluster the meetings to one part of the day. Highly recommend working in pomodoros.

One of the biggest reasons our to-do lists don’t get done is because

Intent doesn’t drive things

Action does.

And Action needs a defined time to do things.

How do you start your workday?

I am writing a book.

There, I said it.

The first book agent I met called out that I wasn’t a celebrity

‘Why will people want to buy what you write?”, he asked.

That is fair. I don’t know.

But more than any external factor, the one thing that holds folks back is themselves.

We are harshly critical of ourselves. At least, I am.

I tend to think of ways in which I could have done things differently after every meeting.

And for the longest time, I felt like I needed permission.

From someone.

For me to do things I loved to do.

Until I realised I would want to write even if no one ever read it.

So well, I don’t have a finalised publisher. I don’t have a final draft.

I even need to align on the themes with my co-author and finally find the time to do so.

But they are solvable problems.

The one that took the longest though was to convince myself

What are the dreams that you are awaiting external validation to start?

“Perhaps the most critical communication skill – Be brief.

Use as few words as possible to say what you need, and everyone will appreciate it.

After writing every sentence it helps to ask “Would the reader still get my point if I deleted that line?”

Not “Does that sentence make sense?” Millions of unnecessary sentences make sense.

Treating words like they cost you something is the right mindset.

A writer once recommended imagining someone pays you $100 for every word you remove from your draft. Another quipped: “Leave out the parts readers tend to skip.”

Poor communicators ramble. Good communicators leave out unnecessary details.

Great communicators treat words as the scarcest commodity.”

This is one the three rare skills that [Morgan Housel](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) calls out in his blog.

It is a skill I still work on. My default has been to explain my position.

Part of being a good communicator, I realise, is to be clear about what you want to communicate.

Even before you utter it out loud.

What is a skill you are working on improving?

All time isn’t created equal.

Dad was always the ambitious one at his career – he was probably the most sought out person at his workplace.

He was a proud man – proud that he was close to indispensable. He held to his beliefs and integrity, spending close to 3 decades at the place, growing steadily through the ranks.

Everyone loved ‘Mani saar’.

Until he turned 50 and was forced to stop working due to health concerns. His world and his identity came crashing down.

All the things he planned and wanted to do – were now only pipe dreams.

Amongst every other way, it impacted us and me, the one that I hold dearest is ‘Time is a premium’ – you never know how much time you have left.

We treat money as a currency to optimize – whilst the one that we should be concerned about is time.

We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over a year.

I singularly value my time over everything else.

It explains why I am always looking at figuring out what I need to say no to and what high leverage activities to focus on.

Leverage is a powerful mental model that has applications across all aspects of life.

Gaining Disproportionate Outcomes comes from identifying how you spend your time on high leverage activities.

Ones where you can achieve a large increase in output for a relatively small amount of additional input.

“You’re spending time to save money when you should be spending money to save time”

“Where do you want to be in 10 years” is a popular interview question.

One that I have always had concerns with.

Here are some serious drawbacks with that 10 year plan – the world around you isn’t static.

2022 isn’t a linear progression of 2012.

So what do you do?

“If you want to seize the new opportunities and meet the challenges in today’s landscape, you need to think and act like you’re running a startup:

Your career”

That is the TL-DR version of the new podcast I stumbled upon that I quite love – [Reid Hoffman](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Ben Casnocha](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s

‘The Startup of You’

I picked up the title based on the same concept recently.

Here is advice from the book that can help plan your 2032

**#1** “Your identity is not found through introspection but rather emerges through experimentation”

**#2** “Entrepreneurial career planning is about being flexibly persistent: always ready to adapt, but also persistent in driving towards set goals.

**#3** They call this ABZ planning

Plan A: What you’re doing now. Your current implementation of your competitive advantage.

Plan B: What you pivot to when you need to change either your goal or the route for getting there.

Plan Z: The fallback position. Your lifeboat if your plan fails and you need to reload before getting back in the game. The certainty of Plan Z is what allows you to take on uncertainty and risk in your plans A and B.

There is no set way to think about your career – there is more than one framework they recommend to how you want to grow

On that topic – how do you think about your career planning?

What was your first job?

  
The first couple of roles we play have an inordinate amount of influence on our careers.

To how we work, what we end up doing and the leaders we then become (or don’t want to become:)) 

And that, therefore, should be an intentional choice to make.

  
I loved [Deborah Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) recent post on her first job in a fast food restaurant and her learnings around how the hardest of jobs are undervalued.

  
That is an area we could improve upon – we frown down upon letting our kids take up service jobs before starting their careers since they can be hugely character building activities.

  
In my last year of Electronics Engineering, much like most others, I got placed in TCS. 

As fate would have it, they pushed out the joining date by 4 months. Uncertainty isn’t something I am comfortable with and I went on an interviewing spree – landing 3 offers out of college, finally choosing to join the [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) India Development team

  
This photo popped up this morning, from our first year at work 

It shows part of our batch of engineers – fresh-faced and eager to prove ourselves to the world. 

(and yet my first thought was – ‘Oh, I was quite chubby:))

  
Of all the exciting firsts I recall from my time there, a couple stand out.

– Thanks to my technical lead, to this day, I cannot stand a poorly commented piece of code.

– And thanks to my first boss, a value that I hold dearly is ‘Be respectful, Be nice’.

  
What was your first job? And what do you still carry from there?

Why do folks feel unhappy about their careers?

If you think deeply, most of the unhappiness stems from dissonance.

Dissonance between what we are doing and what we think we should be doing.

The goal, then is to keep that gap as small as possible.

How does one do that? Through a lot of things.

But it starts with surrounding yourself with people and an org culture that is aligned to your personal values.

A personal value that is a deal-breaker for me is Fairness.

Here is a lovely story Ben Horowitz narrates around retaining core values.

Interviewer : “How do you make trade offs when you can’t optimize for everything? …..we had a star engineer who was critical and was quitting because he’d gotten a higher offer somewhere else. I came to you, and I said, “we need to retain this person.”

It wasn’t that big of a deal to match the offer. We could afford it. You said, “no, we’re not doing that.”

Because if we do that with this guy, then we’ve got to do that with everybody else. But how do people know when to match offers? Sometimes, there is a short-term emergency where, if you don’t do it, you’re dead.

How do you decide whether to optimize for the long term or the near term? How do you think about that?

**Ben:** I think that one thing that people care about a lot in a company and in life is fairness. Is there some set of rules at work that if I do my job, if I make my contribution and so forth, I’m going to be treated fairly? That’s a big thing.

My management philosophy at that time and the way we were doing things is: we evaluate everybody on a frequent basis together, and then whoever is performing the best gets the raise.

Not the person who quits and gets another job offer, not the person who asks for it, and so forth.

That was the principle.

Because the whole thing that we had agreed upon was that we had this process, so anybody who followed the process got screwed”

What are your core values?

“Franz Kafka, the story goes, encountered a little girl in the park where he went walking daily.

She was crying. She had lost her doll and was desolate.

Kafka offered to help her look for the doll and arranged to meet her the next day at the same spot.

Unable to find the doll he composed a letter from the doll and read it to her when they met.

“Please do not mourn me, I have gone on a trip to see the world. I will write you of my adventures.”

This was the beginning of many letters. When he and the little girl met he read her from these carefully composed letters the imagined adventures of the beloved doll.

The little girl was comforted.

When the meetings came to an end Kafka presented her with a doll.

She obviously looked different from the original doll. An attached letter explained: “my travels have changed me… “

Many years later, the now grown girl found a letter stuffed into an unnoticed crevice in the cherished replacement doll.

In summary it said: “every thing that you love, you will eventually lose, but in the end, love will return in a different form.”

I recently came across this beautiful story around the pervasiveness of loss and went online to confirm its veracity.

“Metamorphosis” by Franz Kakfa was a book someone gifted me when I was too young to comprehend it.

But something I think I will re-read now.

This remarkable gesture of kindness from Kafka puts loss and living into perspective. It reminded me of my dad and everything beautiful about the world around us.

Something 18 hour working days won’t give us – the joy of just being.

How much do you focus on existing product performance vs future big bets?

And what folks like your or I can do differently within our organisations?

In a classic, Geoffrey Moore’s Stanford video talks about how companies build the escape velocity to move beyond the successes and pull from the past?

We all have read of companies that failed to do so in time.

Think Blackberry – from a 20% market share in 2009 to less than 0.05% in 2016.

Why does it happen and how can organisations avoid it?

Here are the key take-aways

**#1What** happens when we focus on performance alone : When companies focus too much on performance, they miss out on building the power to become the industry leaders that other companies envy.

Example : If you pollute the air, it’s free. And as long as it’s free people will continue with the behavior.

But unless we think about replenishing the failing system – that’s exactly what will happen.

**#2Evaluate** how you compensate – Are your teams compensated only for performance or also for creating/driving new opportunities/strategy.

**#3How** long can you get away with it

“Now, the interesting thing is, in a mature industry you can do that for a long, long time. General Motors consumed its own power for 40 years. Eventually, it ran out of power.”

**#4You** Manage what you measure

Do your metrics track only performance?

**#5What** happens in a world in which we don’t consciously manage power, is we continue to put anxiety and pressure to perform, perform, perform, but every quarter it’s a little harder to do than the last quarter”

Do give it a listen! Highly recommend

A mentor once told me a secret

To do well at the workplace

And in life

‘Assuming Goodwill’

Conflicts and disagreements at workplaces, are inevitable

There are two ways in which I have seen people handle such –

Victimhood and Cynicism

The former assumes the mentality of blame – that makes one lose a sense of control over their environment

The other – ‘brings out the worst in their colleagues, leading cynics’ suspicion and distrust to become self-fulfilling prophecies”

Largely, people have the right intentions and misses could be gaps in communication or misaligned priorities

When you approach situations assuming goodwill – one starts with curiosity to learn why vs going in with a fixed mindset

This article shares ‘tactics include redirecting the organisational culture toward collaboration and trust and making sure that all managers—not just those at the top—are modeling trusting behaviours and combating cynicism in their interaction’

What behaviours have you or your leaders helped model within your teams towards better outcomes?

Ajay was a lead I had in one of my early roles.

Razor-sharp and focussed – he truly emulated the paradigm – “Work like a lion rather than graze like a cow”

I recall him telling me to optimise for energy vs time

That as a morning person, he started his day quite early – and got most of his work done within the first 4 hours of the day.

Post which he usually met folks or looked at non-critical tasks, if any.

He left office at 5 sharp to hit the gym, meet friends and call it an early night.

A lot has been said last week around ‘Quiet Quitting’

Here is an article that manages to take a balanced view at interpreting the Tik Tok trend

As the interview puts it, “Quiet quitting doesn’t actually involve quitting. It confused me when I first heard of the term as well. Instead, it’s been deemed a response to hustle culture and burnout. Employees are, I guess, quitting going above and beyond, declining to do the tasks that they are not being paid for. “

What are your thoughts on the trend?

What if ‘Humankind is given a Universal Basic Income’?

The thought was partly triggered because I had just read Daniel Susskind’s ‘A World Without Work’

And because I love futuristic technology and I wonder about things like why we work beyond it being a means of sustenance

And about how our jobs are so tied to our identities today

And what happens if/when at a point in future, that becomes optional to work

Would we still pursue vocations? What are the areas where we will still like to retain humans vs AI

What would you choose to do in a world without work?

Have you wondered why we work 40 hour work weeks?

As recent as early 1900’s, industrial era worked clocked in close to 100 hours.

What drove the change in standards?

I was listening to [Rory Sutherland](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s brilliant interview in the podcast – Diary of the CEO, where he called out this quirky fact

In 1926, Henry Ford made a groundbreaking change by being one of the first significant companies to change his work policy to 40-hour weeks

With five working days and no change in wages.

“He realised that if companies were to make a profit, customers needed to buy things;

And in order to want to go shopping, customers needed to relax and enjoy themselves.

For this, they needed more time off work.’

If you notice closely, Rory suggests you understand not just what people want but why.

For example, we don’t necessarily ‘want cabs to arrive faster’ (it is easy to consider building a predictive model to solution for it) but what we want is the predictability – knowing when our cab will arrive

A feature that ride hailing apps today provide.

Brilliant episode to understand the magic behind human psychology that drives businesses

How to be more productive – 3 Tips you can try this week

**#The** Idea Dump : I learnt this first from [James Altucher](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) who recommends carrying a notebook to capture all the thoughts and ideas that cross your mind.

Over time, he says, you train your brain to become an ‘idea machine’

**#2Important** vs the Urgent : When listing stuff to do for the day, I time box it into important and the urgent tasks.

Usually we tend to focus on the urgent tasks and ignore important (and usually longer gratification items – ex, Fitness, Up skilling or understanding the business domain)

**#Tune** out when doing deep work.

You tend to accomplish more in 2 hours of deep-work vs a day of distracted focus.

[Naval Ravikant](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) calls this ‘work like a lion instead of grazing like a cow’

[Rajan Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) recommends to keep your phones at arm’s distance, switch off notifications and check mails (or slack ) only at pre-defined intervals.

Book recommendation on the topic – Cal Newport’s Deep Work

I think the first time I met [Guru Bhat](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) was at a conference where he spoke about the Art of Storytelling.

I was absolutely blown away by his depth and charisma as a leader, and the intense self awareness and knowledge, he exudes

Since then, I have followed everything he has written on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) – from leadership to career principles

I have come out of every conversation with him, feeling overwhelmed by how little I know, to being inspired by wanting to be like him.

Guru is currently the VP of Customer Success Platforms for PayPal and responsible for Product Management and Engineering for all technology delivering customer success. 

He is also the General Manager of PayPal’s India Centers (5000+ employees) in Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad.

Beyond all that, he is an exceptional leader.

So when I decided to do **#Leadertalks** as part of PIVOT – to Support and Connect Women in Product and AI to Scale into Leadership, I couldn’t think of a better leader to start with, than Guru Bhat

I am super excited to host [Guru Bhat](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) in Episode 2 of **#LeaderTalks** as part of PIVOT this Saturday (20 Aug) between 11 AM – 12 PM, IST on Linkedin LIVE.

What happens when we have DALL-E like images generated, for free?

Generative AI may no longer be just a novel idea

But as a tool available across

If the frameworks are open sourced as it is expected to be

While it is quite exciting to cross into unknown territory, it can also be a potential cause of concern

“DALL-E 2, OpenAI’s powerful text-to-image AI system, can create photos in the style of cartoonists,…..

But it has an important, artificial limitation: a filter that prevents it from creating images depicting public figures and content deemed too toxic.

Now an open source alternative to DALL-E 2 is on the cusp of being released, and it’ll have few — if any — such content filters.”

London- and Los Altos-based startup Stability AI this week announced the release of a DALL-E 2-like system, Stable Diffusion, to just over a thousand researchers ahead of a public launch in the coming weeks.

…Stable Diffusion is designed to run on most high-end consumer hardware, generating 512×512-pixel images in just a few seconds given any text prompt.

When it comes to data, businesses tend to have a ‘capability centric’ vs a ‘user centric’ view

And no one feels the pain more – than the end customer

And the data analyst

“How do I turn data into a ‘sustainable advantage’

How do I create an innovation flywheel for customers, partners and employees

How do I use data as center of a product that I can further monetize”

Those are top of mind items that a data leader in any organization looks at, says Bruno Aziza, Head of Data Analytics at Google

The data can reside in multiple places – a data warehouse, data mart or a data lake.

The legacy systems can hugely hamper agility

Organisations that win look at taking advantage of your existing environment – without the need to change users habits.

**#Can** you govern it intelligently

**#Provide** end users capabilities to do their work

**#Can** you enable multiple use cases through an access and a governance stand point

**#Self** Service capabilities so that people can do their job easily

So how do we do that?

“Monolithic, legacy architectures and centralised data platforms thwart business’ agility, making it difficult to quickly adjust to the constantly changing data landscape that demands new views, new aggregations”

That is where a decentralized data mesh could help

“Both data fabric and data mesh architectures aim to abstract data management complexity and deliver data to the business with agility and scale.”

What does that imply?

“Data fabric is a design concept and architecture geared toward addressing the complexity of data management and minimising disruption to data consumers while ensuring that any data on any platform from any location can be successfully combined, accessed, shared, and governed efficiently and effectively”.

In Simpler words?

Data warehouse, data lake or data mart – > It doesn’t matter

Think of them as nodes in a data fabric that are discoverable, accessible and governed

“Data mesh focuses on organisational change – enabling domain teams to own the delivery of data products with the understanding that the domain teams are closer to their data and thus understand their data better.”

In Plain English?

It enables delivering customised data products linked to business objectives

“Metadata driven Data Fabric” is one of Gartner’s 12 Data and Analytics Trends, 2022

Organisations that win this race are those who look at Data as product.

You don’t enforce capabilities onto users

You start with User Outcomes and build capabilities around it.

“It’s not in anyone’s best interest to work from home, and corporate leaders should be telling their employees to get back into the office so they can “feel part of something,” wrote writer Malcolm Gladwell.

Stirring up a hornet’s nest.

One can see why work from anywhere can be such a compelling proposition.

While on a vacation recently, I managed to catch a couple of hours of deep work to wrap up a presentation for an upcoming conference.

Let alone the lowered cost of living and flexibility, just the sheer joy of working amidst nature is a huge win.

As an HBR article called out, “…if leaders support synchronous and asynchronous communication, brainstorming, and problem-solving; lead initiatives to codify knowledge online; encourage virtual socialization, team building, and mentoring; invest in and enforce data security; work with government stakeholders to ensure regulatory compliance; and set an example by becoming WFA employees themselves, all-remote organizations may indeed emerge as the future of work”

All of that is easier said than done – there are definitely multiple tactical issues such as good connectivity, access to teams across time-zones to cultural mindset and assumed goodwill to be solved for.

Most of all, opening up remote work has allowed us to open doors for a global workforce

And like a mentor once told me –

“Well, it’s the most democratising thing to happen – levelling the playing field.

I don’t need to forcibly socialise or worry about missing networking during smoke breaks”.

What do you think is required for WFA/Hybrid work to succeed?

Have you watched the movie 2012?

I recall turning to my husband and asking him, “So are we saying that in a country with a billion plus population – not one could afford to get onto the ark?

And more importantly, all we are doing is praying to the gods waiting for the waves to wash us away?” 🙂

My current read, Factfulness, addresses a critical space – with data.

About how our world has (and continues to become) a much better place over time.

He makes a strong case for The Myth of Us vs Them

Around Why the “Developed and Developing world” distinction no longer works

And the tropes that media feeds us is probably 30 years old. It is beyond everything else – lazy.

“Of all the myths spread by the media, perhaps none is more detrimental than Us vs Them: the idea that the world is divided into two groups – good and the evil”

Or the developed vs the developing.

Whereas, in fact, the gap is where the majority lies.

“In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens.

They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective—from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse)”

“There’s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.”

Highly recommend!

Metaverse and How it Will Change the World with [Matthew Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)

[Sahil Bloom](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s podcast episode with him on “Where it Happens”, is singularly one of the best things I have heard in recent times

Here are 5 reasons why

I am a futurist at heart – thus Metaverse and how that could shape our tech trajectory continues to be niggling question.

**#1** While I tend to think tech isn’t inherently good or bad but depends on the intentions of the user, Metaverse is a space I don’t know where to stand.

Partially because I don’t know enough – and largely because we are shaped by narratives. As a binge consumer of sci-fi genre, SnowCrash, Ender’s game, Klara and the Sun… all tend to portray a dystopian future.

Mathew makes a solid point around how utopia doesn’t create drama and how dystopia thus drives the tropes we see around us.

**#2** As we unravel the parallel world online, there are a lot of good questions but we are yet to work out good answers. Like ownership, or governance or how we can drive consensus based behavior.

**#3** How does social media go from what we describe to where we live?

I loved the distinction Matthew Ball made in terms of how Facebook isn’t how we live life, but how we represent it. The Metaverse on the other hand is where we will live out our actions.

That showcases the humongous challenge that lies in creating a persistent infrastructure with new rules powered with massive computational power.

**#4** Would we know when it ‘arrives’?

Did we looking back know how we arrived to this state – what are the indicators we ought to look for? And how the need to decentralize( or rather move away from centralization) has driven us to where we are today

**#5** Finally, the most important question – what does it mean to us all. Are we doomed to a future that we don’t design. How do I raise my kid? What would she do in the face of her peers who grow up with Roblox?

I personally think it is a convoluted question to answer. I like his optimism in each of us holding a sense of agency in creating a future we would love to live in.

And as a parent, a persistent thread that continues to run in my head – around how I can provide the opportunities to my kid to help reach her potential

Irrespective of where she comes from.

I just picked up the book and will share a review shortly.

In the meantime, give this a listen.

What makes a CEO?

[Mastercard](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s former CEO Ajay Banga, shared his game changing vision, in the book CEO Excellence.

“I was walking through the office and saw the slogan written in a staircase : ‘Mastercard, the Heart of Commerce”.

It made me think, ‘But commerce is mostly in cash, right?’ I realised nobody in the company talked about cash.

If anything, they talked about Visa and Amex and other local schemes.

“That led me to figure out the % of transactions in the world that were happening in cash. That number exceeded 85% just for consumer transactions. From then on I talked about our vision as being to ‘kill cash’.

Instead of fighting for a piece of the 15% of transactions that were electronic, we fought for a piece of the 85% that weren’t (yet).

So one of the traits the book recommends makes a successful CEO is how they ‘reframed what winning meant for their companies’.

They didn’t just raise the aspiration levels, they changed the definition of success.

Personally, I feel being a CEO isn’t just a title but a mindset of how one operates – from setting the vision and culture, mobilising the teams to managing one’s time and energy.

Yes, one can aspire to be a CEO (like I hope to, some day) but you don’t need the title to think and work like one.

The book lists the below 6 responsibilities of the CEO.

What do you think are the trait(s) that drive the CEO’s you admire?

How do you think work has changed over the last 15 years?

In one word – Unrecognisably

This picture is from an offsite from my first job at [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) – 15 years ago. Fresh-faced and naive.

“Change happens slowly and then all at once”

The futurist (and optimist) that I am, I oft think about how will work will look like in 10 years.

And more importantly, what do we tell our children

As a PWC report called out, ‘This isn’t a time to sit back and wait for events to unfold. To be prepared for the future you have to understand it”

There are 5 Megatrends that the report calls out that will shape that narrative

**#1Technological** breakthroughs – Rapid advances in technological innovation

**#2Demographic** shifts – The changing size, distribution and age profile of the world’s population

**#3Rapid** urbanisation – Significant increase in the world’s population moving to live in cities

**#4Shifts** in global economic power – Power shifting between developed and developing countries

**#5Resource** scarcity and climate change – Depleted fossil fuels, extreme weather, rising sea levels and water shortages

It further talks about 4 different worlds of work in 2030

– The Yellow World (Humans come first)

– The Red World (Innovation rules)

– The Green World (Companies care)

– The Blue World (Corporate is king)

I personally believe it could be a combination of these, swayed largely by what you do and where you live.

So here is the thing about change and the future – while we can worry about automation and losing jobs, the future is what we make of it.

So what can we tell our children?

“That to stay ahead, you need to focus on your ability to continuously adapt, engage with others in that process, and most importantly retain your core sense of identity and values.

And that the future isn’t a fixed destination”

That is **#MyWorkPrediction**. What is yours?

\[P.S – If you are wondering what we are all staring at – it was our boss who was trying to climb up the tree!

Maybe some things don’t change – I have been lucky to have brilliant leaders all through :)\]

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) can, at times, be quite a microcosm – representing not the world as is but the world we usually interact with.

“Can you help my daughter find a job as a nanny”, my cook asked me last week.

I looked up from what I was reading. “I can check in the apartment groups if anyone is looking. Has she worked as a nanny before?”, I asked.

“No akka (sister, in Kannada). She used to do a ‘big job’ in a ‘big hospital’ as a peon earning almost 20K INR (\~250 USD)/month. But she has left that job now”

Why so, was my first thought. After much discussion I learnt that her son-in-law asked her daughter to resign.

Why? Because he once visited and saw that her role required her talking to ‘strange men’ – something ‘he wasn’t comfortable with her doing’.

Here was a woman trying to be independent, having to now look for another job because her spouse had insecurities

Beyond crashing her dreams, think about the implications to their kids’ and their education – something that additional income could have helped.

It is a downward spiral.

Overcoming the income gap within a generation has become increasingly harder.

Generational wealth feeds the trope of rich becoming richer.

Education is singularly the driver that can help bridges that gap.

And beyond it all, while I can continue to talk about my rights as a woman or the lack of it, there are a multitude of worlds around us where the concept of rights doesn’t even exist.

So here is reminding myself that the world isn’t just what I see around me. And the privilege and thereby responsibility each of us hold for fellow humans around us 🙂

What separates those who make it to the top from others?

Have you wondered why each of us who begin at the same starting line navigate different trajectories through life?

And what choices make them different. Can we really learn to make better choices?

When I considered doing a **#LeaderTalk** series pre-Covid one of the first people I thought of talking to was the extraordinary [Pankaj Rai (He/Him/His)](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

No better time than his birthday to post an excerpt from the recording!

Pankaj, who is currently the Chief Data Analytics Office at Aditya Birla was one of my earliest bosses and has continued to be a mentor and guide.

I love his sass, his philosophical outlook to life and a larger than life network! He is, as someone put, it a ‘serial giver’ – connecting people to one another.

Inversion is a mental model that talks about using the strategy of avoiding bad decisions.

For example, say you want to improve innovation in your organization. Thinking forward, you’d think about all of the things you could do to foster innovation. If you look at the problem by inversion, however, you’d think about all the things you could do that would discourage innovation. Ideally, you’d avoid those things.

So how do we make better choices?

Listen to Pankaj talk about choices that helped navigate his career.

Why the best products are built from simple systems – Gall’s Law

“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.

A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.

You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system”

Oft, we come across multi-year plans for building complex systems, yet complex systems are full of variables and Interdependencies that must be arranged just right in order to function.

Nike started by reselling running shoes from a Japanese manufacturer. Today, Nike is the world’s largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel.

**Most successful products started from a simple idea, a small step, which later led to incremental improvements**

Here are 5 steps to consider when we build systems –

**#1Use** iterative processes.

**#2Reuse** known to be working modules.

**#3Release** early, release often.

**#4Use** automated testing to ensure that enhancing the system does not break it.

**#5Start** small and incrementally add changes – avoid building a one size fits all.

This applies – whether you are are startup building your roadmap or a tech/product leader designing your roadmap

“This is the problem with living in the 21st century.

… We are made to feel poor on thirty thousand pounds a year.

To feel old if we have a wrinkle.

To feel ugly if we aren’t photoshopped and filtered.

No one I knew in the 1600s wanted to find their inner billionaire.

They just wanted to live to see adolescence and avoid body lice”

How to Stop Time tells a love story across the ages- about a man lost in time

Tom Hazard looks like your average forty-something guy but actually has a rare medical condition that makes him age slower than the average human.

So he’s around five-hundred years old. What changes in how we live when that happens across centuries

Tom has performed with Shakespeare, explored with Captain Cook, shared a cocktail with F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and experienced the drastic changes the world has undergone through the centuries

It sometimes feels like I want to reach out and grab a narrative out of it while none exists.

The story meanders across centuries that I stopped to reflect what the book meant to me

Maybe this quote captured it best –

> “That’s the thing with time, isn’t it? It’s not all the same.
> 
> Some days – some years – some decades – are empty. There is nothing to them. It’s just flat water. And then you come across a year, or even a day, or an afternoon. And it is everything. It is the whole thing.”

‘Ajay had expanded upon his charter to take up a new area.

The new team was still in its formation and there were a number of challenges he could immediately see.

Including lack of processes and clear scope. He worked with his teams to identify the gaps and requirements. He knew what would work based on his previous experience and put together a proposal.

When he enthusiastically presented it to the management in the next MBR, he was met with… silence.

What do you think happened there?

An area we fail to think when solving problems is this –

” Does everyone have the same view of the problem as I do”

Action bias is good. But when we jump into solutioning before we are clear ourselves/peers about the problem statement, we are likely to be setting ourselves up for failure.

So what could have Ajay done differently?

Maybe talk to his Data Engineering and Product counterparts to understand their perspectives

And built allies and alignment for his proposal before presenting to the leadership.”

This isn’t the story of Ajay, but something I have seen this narrative play out multiple times across workplaces

Tell me about a time when you failed at your workplace? And what were your learnings from that?

‘Can we build moral machines’?

In an experiment, Alan Winfield showed “how a blue robot saved a red robot from walking into a “danger zone” by (gently) colliding with it.

In another, two red robots were heading for danger zones and the blue robot can only save one—an ethical dilemma that endearingly caused it to dither between the two.

The robot behaves ethically not because it chooses to but because it’s programmed to do so,” Winfield said.

“We call it an ethical zombie.”

In this brilliant interview he talks about whether we can create artificially conscious machines and what does it imply if/when we do?

The dystopian science fiction story, “Klara and the Sun”, by Kazuo Ishigaro, told the story of Klara, a solar-powered AF (Artificial Friend), who is chosen by Josie, a sickly child, to be her companion.

The ending shows the AF left out in a Wall-E reminiscent environment to fend for itself until it runs out.

It begs the question, if we build machines that are conscious, can they suffer from our actions?

Or if they even do, are we even going to be aware of them.

Give this a read.

Have you read Carl Sagan’s Pale Blue Dot?

It references Earth’s appearance from space taken by Voyager in 1990

“Look again at that dot.

That’s here. That’s home. That’s us.

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.

The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

\[…\]

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.

To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.”

Again, this week is a historical moment.

We get to witness the first images from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope

Revealing unprecedented and detailed views of the universe.

Like this stellar image of the Carina Nebula that sheds light on how new stars are formed

It is one the most beautiful images I have ever seen – A human made this happen.

It is also a reminder of how transient our lives are in the context of the universe and cosmic time.

Or as Carl Sagan said “Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light”

“Why women are so hard on themselves”- How to stop ‘shoulding’ oneself

I was chatting with this young girl I mentor.

She mentioned a relatively common phenomenon – Being hard and judging herself poorly.

She felt she wasn’t doing her best at her role – Which was understandable given she was new at it.

Maybe time would set that right – maybe picking up new skills would. Or giving herself the space might.

But while that happens, self-inflicted judgement can tend to wreck chaos.

“Like being submerged”, as she put it.

What can we do to avoid saying, ‘I should have done more’.

‘Did I miss something’.

“I should have spoken up’ or ‘I shouldn’t I have said that’

“’Shoulding’ is the act of trying to motivate yourself through some sort of obligation or shaming process”

I don’t honestly know what it takes to break years of conditioning.

But it starts with being aware of it when you do it to yourself.

I wonder if it is a gender neutral phenomenon. Or if there are any books on the topic.

When was the last time you were hard on yourself?

I was close to burning out a few months ago with all the things I wanted to do and the finite time we have.

Here is a tip that helped take a step back and evaluate.

You don’t land your next role by doing more of what you are already doing.

Scaling requires very different skills including learning when and where to intervene to support your teams.

It also requires one to learn quickly and effectively.

To effectively learn, before you start, figure out if it’s a hard skill or a soft skill.

Hard Skills – Require Repeatable precision. Think practising music.

This is found in specialised pursuits – physical sport, for example.

In such cases your goal is to – “Always be consistent”

Soft Skills – Highly flexible skills.

Those that have many paths to a good result. This is more about being agile and interactive.

About recognising patterns as they unfold and making smart, timely choices.

This is found in broader, less specialised pursuits. Example – involving communication, stock trading or a CEO reading a room.

It is harder to master and requires focussed efforts.

Here is a litmus test to identify the category

If a teacher/coach is involved in the early stages, it is more likely a hard skill.

So next time, before you start on something, pause to ask if it is a hard or a soft skill.

We have been in scenarios where the Dev teams take actions to expedite delivery – prioritising for speed over perfect code.

That is what is called “Tech Debt”

While this oft could happen – making this a practise is what kills good teams.

In the book, Superthinking, one of the mental models the authors talk about is looking at ‘short termism’ as a strategy.

“Short-termism can easily lead to the accumulation of technical debt and create disadvantageous path dependence….”

This extends to one of Joel’s 12 steps to better code – Do you fix bugs before writing new code?

The longer you wait, the harder it gets.

As leadership, are you ensuring your teams aren’t driven only by short term goals?

Books of 2022

Here are my books from the first half of 2022 and 5 reflections on reading

**#1** This year I decided not to force myself to read books towards ‘being better’ and read ‘to enjoy’ – yet I gravitated towards ones I feel I derive most ‘value’ from.

**#2** Experimentation – I switched from sticking to thrillers in fiction to romance but didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would – yet, I loved the experience.

**#3** Nonetheless, thanks to the loose boundaries, I ended up reading a lot more Crichton and Agatha Christie than I wanted to – classics that I quite enjoyed

**#4** I skimmed through some of them (Breath) whilst I re-read others (SuperThinking). Not all books seem to deserve the same mental faculties

**#5** Time boxing for books aligned to my energy levels – To optimize my reading, I do Audio books for heavy non-fiction which I do when multi tasking in the mornings, lighter non-fiction in Kindle at night and mysteries and thrillers as a paper back on weekends

And finally, it doesn’t matter if you read 30 or 3.

What does is you do.

There are too many books and too little time 🙂

Happy Reading!

I have always struggled with taking risks

Risk implies potential failures.

And I hated failing. 

It was very easy to be the child every parent wanted to have – studious, following the rules and being every teachers’ favorite.

But oft, I wondered if that is what I really wanted to do with my life – why I always aspired to live to others’ expectations rather than my own

Of being the ‘model daughter’

And that is why I am in such awe of Sowjanya….

With a 25+ career that has had stints from analytics to sales. She has started over again and again.

Prioritising seeking fulfillment for herself over everything else.

Here is her story –

“We’re all put in moulds. Stop and think about it: What’s your mould made of? Stereotypes, expectations, limitations, obligations and you can fill in the blanks hereon… 

Woman, man, any gender and every identity – we’re force-fitted to a mould. So, who can break your mould? Only you.

That power lies within us.

Say a mental “aye” if you relate.

I’ve had 25+ years of diverse experience in an oh-so-’squiggly’ career. 

Having grown up in a single-parent household with strong female influence, I’ve never had anything come easy. And I have put in the work to try to get what I deserve, at every step.

The epicentre of my evolving experiences has always been learning. 

Through my early years, various jobs, multiple roles, and my very own transformation journey (ongoing, for all of us!) 

And that’s why, with my privileges, I’m at a place that allows me to present ‘attitude makeover’ as a growth facilitator and a mirror of reflection to you.

My journey has taught me it can be transformative to experience discomfort. Even if it feels scary, taking a strategic leap of faith can move you into new realms. 

It revolves around confronting habit with habit, those which will help you evolve. 

Making ‘taking the plunge’ a habit, as a first step almost. My video podcasts are the fruition of the same. 32+ episodes later, I’m enjoying and still discovering my creative self every day. Hence, Attitude Makeover branches out from a very personal place. 

Because, it is about conviction, even for the unconventional. By introspectively looking at one’s facets, consciously recognizing true values, honing the life skills required, and consciously embarking on that career growth journey.

REALIZE. VISUALIZE. ACTUALIZE – That’s our cue to GET, SET, GO!”

Have you taken a risk at your career?

It is my personal goal to help more women overcome the ‘broken rung’ and scale at their careers.

It was early 2020 and I had just lost dad.

I was lost and torn. In a typical manner (that I don’t recommend) I thought I could fill my time to the brim with things to do.

So that I don’t have to think about what I didn’t want to accept.

I volunteered to be part of the core team to drive the site start-up engagement and happened to sit next to [P Ramani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) who led the initiative.

As they say, what follows is history. He was and continues to be a mentor, guide and friend. I haven’t seen another who exemplifies being an Ally, as much as he.

This is his story. I am forever indebted for all that you continue to do to – with authenticity and passion 🙂

“I will start with a short story. 

20+ years ago I was a rookie manager. 

A women employee in my team walked into my office and said she wanted to resign. She and I grew the ranks together. 

Always considered her my friend and colleague more than employee. She had her 3rd baby. As we started talking, I realized between the cost of day care and the time she had to spend with the family she wasn’t able to continue to work.

 I asked her what will she do few years down the road. Of course none of us knew DEI or broken rung in those days. It was just me trying to figure out how not to lose her. 

I asked her if she would consider going part time and see if that works before taking a call on quitting. She was okay to try that but the company had no policy on this. I went and talked to my VP and HR. Initially both were skeptical but came around to this and said we can try this on a trial basis for 6-months. 

We did this and later did some adjustments to her comp too. At the end of the trial period we extended this. I relocated to India. She is still with the company. 

We had earned her trust and supported her when she need it the most and she repaid it by sticking with the same company! 

As a manager it is very easy to say there isn’t a policy for this. Or it is easy to point to a faceless organisation called HR and say they are not allowing it. However, as a manager we play a very important role in fixing this broken rung problem. As a manager this is what we signed up to do. 

That is, be there for our team, be prepared to challenge status quo, develop empathy and truly understand our teams needs and find ways to help them”

Is there a story you have to share as an Ally to drive inclusion at your workplace?

This is part of the series to get **#100WomeninManagement** as a personal goal. Have a story or leader to feature, DM me.

People don’t always get what they deserve

We are brought up with a cognitive bias that assumes that actions have morally fair and fitting consequences.

That the noble actions will be rewarded and evil will be punished. This also impacts the way we interpret others’ actions.

The Just World Hypothesis postulates that

‘It can be challenging to acknowledge that a good portion of your success stems from luck”

I speak from a position of privilege when I talk about financial independence given I was born to parents who valued equality and education.

One where I could go back to work 3 months after my maternity leave because I had a solid support system.

I also am aware that I can be the minority in the room oft assumed to be there to take notes. That it isn’t always assumed that I understand tech until I call it out.

“Many people instead choose to believe that the world is completely fair, orderly, and predictable.”

This mental model is called the just world hypothesis – where people always get what they deserve, good or bad, because of their actions alone, with no accounting for luck or randomness.

As the book Superthinking calls out, being aware of this mental model would allow you to understand the world a teensy bit better 🙂

As [Morgan Housel](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) puts it, teach you kids that

**“Not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness.** 

**Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself”**

The one where we talk about ‘How to Lead with Intent and Pay it forward’

[Preeti Chaudhary](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is quite a powerhouse.

She is a founder, mentor, venture partner, board member, speaker…

But most importantly an Inclusion ambassador. Here is her story and tips on how you can lead with intention.

“My maternal Grandfather – Late Pandit Bhawani Prasad Tiwari was

– A Freedom Fighter

– The VERY FIRST and subsequently 8 times Mayor of my city Jabalpur

– Twice Member Of Parliament from Raiya Sabha and a

– India’s 4th highest civilian award, Padmashri recipient

A family full of highly educated and accomplished women from ALL walks of professions – PhDs, college professors, doctors, architect, software professionals, teachers, musicians etc.

I have seen equity and inclusion, RIGHT at home, from the very beginning!

Add to that my own life principles of being the voice and giving visibility to the most marginalized, unrepresented and invisible people of our society and community – it is a no-brainer I started down the path of inclusion and enablement OF and FOR ALL – Women, Veterans, Persons With Disabilities, LGBT+

Wondering how YOU may further the cause of inclusion, as a person/professional?

Please consider becoming an ALLY!

How?

**#Understanding**/owning up our own privilege

**#Read** up, to get all the nuances right: info on our biases, pronouns and their use, policies, laws etc

**#Be** vocal: lend your voice and speak up in your own social circles

**#Listen** and learn from peoples’ stories

**#ASK** rather than assume anything at all!

**#LISTEN** not just hear!

Lastly, HELP out in whatever capacity you may: with your time, skills, teaching, awareness creation, connecting people, etc

Thank you for the encouragement, by acknowledging and highlighting a part of my story!”

It is my personal goal to help more women overcome the ‘broken rung’ and scale at their careers.

This is part of the series to get **#100WomeninManagement** 

We learn more about ourselves when we lean in for others – what’s your leading with intent story?

The husband and I were changing into non-marking shoes right outside of our Tennis court last week.

When this elderly gentleman who was playing the earlier set walks out. He looks at me and then points out the set of rules nearby

Reading it out loud, almost as if I were a child.

Calling out the fact that anyone who is not playing or practising with the kids should do so in the adjacent practice court.

“Those who aren’t playing shouldn’t use this one’, he proclaims.

“And why would you think I am not the one playing?”, I ask him looking squarely in the eye.

The husband is right beside me – yet he isn’t questioned.

The small things matter.

It doesn’t fail to astound me how many times we are stereotyped and cast into neat little boxes.

Of me being the plus one

Of being asked to talk to my dad or husband about MY finances

Or addressing the brother because I might not ‘be interested in tech’

Yes, we are evolving and yes, I am better off today than my working mom was decades ago.

But we can do better.

As one of our training put it, please pay more attention to our unconscious biases.

Microaggressions aren’t ok.

“You’re trying to buy a sweater, and you go into a store and you find a sweater that fits you.

It looks good. It’s the right price. You buy it, you’re happy, you’re done. Right? It meets all of your criteria. You are a Satisficer.

If you are a Maximizer – you will see that sweater and kind of put it under another sweater, so nobody will buy it.

And just in case, go to the next store.

And keep looking, because maybe they’ll find something a little bit cheaper or a little bit more attractive or, you know, whatever it is, right?

And they keep looking, and then maybe they find it. Maybe they don’t.

But if they do find it, they tend not to be as happy with that purchase as if they had just bought the original sweater.

And if they don’t find it, then they regret that they didn’t get the original one.

And you see this in relationships and with jobs.

It’s with everything.

The satisficer is one who wants what she has, and the maximizer is the one who is always chasing, trying to have what he wants.

Have you stopped to think?

Are you a satisficer, or are you a maximizer?”

– How to Build a Happy Life Podcast by [Arthur Brooks](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) featuring [Lori Gottlieb](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

Probably because I have been contemplating about changes recently. Or maybe because it touches upon what really matters to us

Beautiful podcast. Give it a listen.

<https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/how-to-start-over/id1587046024>

And ask yourself – if you are a satisficer or a maximizer?

A Must-Ask Question to make Good Decisions

I had a 1×1 yesterday with a senior leader I quite admire.

We were chatting about decisions – and how one usually has to make them with incomplete information

She mentioned an instance when she had to move roles and was quite torn about picking the right move

Much like most would, she listed out the pros and cons of each.

Her mentor then asked her a simple question that helped her make the choice –

“Are you choosing this to move away from or to move towards something?”

And as you might guess, good results follow decisions when it is precipitated by ‘moving towards something’

Such a simple, yet powerful heuristic.

“In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing”

How do you make decisions?

What do you do when people you manage fail?

1) You forgive and forget

2) You remember, pass blame, stigmatise and humiliate them

3) You forgive and remember

The right approach that [Bob Sutton](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Professor of Management at Stanford University advocates is to \*forgive\* so that people have psychological safety and \*remember\*, so that you can learn, the person can learn and the organisation can learn

This was part of a course from Stanford on ‘Leading Innovation’ led by Robert Sutton that I highly recommend

The bottom line is this

There can be no innovation or learning without failure.

‘Failure sucks but Instructs’

(This deserves a sticky note at the desk!)

One thing that has helped us become better as a team over time is this –

Try – Iterate- Learn- Improve- Do Better.

> “We have a strategic plan – its called doing things”

Are you providing your teams with psychological safety to succeed?

“In June 1944, Germany flew several raids on London.

War experts plotted the position of each bomb as it fell and noticed one cluster near Regent’s Park, and another along the banks of the Thames.

This clustering concerned them because it implied that the German military had designed a new bomb that was more accurate than any existing bomb.

In fact, the Luftwaffe was dropping bombs randomly, aiming generally at the heart of London. What the experts had seen were clusters that occur naturally through random processes—misleading noise masquerading as a useful signal”

FS Blog uses this example to explain a concept we tend to miss oft – The Law of small numbers – Bias creeping in from insensitivity to small numbers

“This bias comes in many forms.

In a telephone poll of 300 seniors, 60% support the president.

If you had to summarize the message of this sentence in exactly three words, what would they be? Almost certainly you would choose “elderly support president.”

Before drawing conclusions from information about a limited number of events (a sample) selected from a much larger number of events (the population) it is important to understand something about the statistics of samples.”

Why is cognition relevant?

“It explains the rise of stereotypes (concluding that all people with a particular trait behave the same way);

Or the tendency to see short-term patterns in financial stock charts when in fact short-term stock movements almost never follow predictable patterns.

The solution is to pay attention not just to the pattern of data, but also to how much data you have. “

The bottom line is simple, understand the data for what it is

Not to corroborate the stories we want to hear (or tell)

“I want to be doing something different. I want to get promoted to the next role?”

Yesterday, I was chatting with this young woman who asked, what is a very common question.

Our career conversations usually tend to start with what “WE want”

Ironically though, you tend to progress faster when you start with “What existing problems you can solve for with unique talent”

Here are a 3 pointers to get the career conversations right

**#1** Your career discussions always happen in rooms where you aren’t there to represent yourself. Are you ensuring that you have sponsors/leaders who are aware and can champion your cause?

**#2** Be curious and remove your blinders – We tend to stick to what we are being asked to do. Be curious about what is happening around, what decisions get taken, why, who are the movers, and how it impacts the organisation.

Ex – Ask your leaders about problems that they are working on and figure out the ones that align with your skills. Give before you take.

**#3** Build a unique ‘skill stack’ – The Scott Adams model

The Dilbert creator says he wasn’t the most skilled artist and yet he has one of the top-rated comic strips.

What he says he has is the combination of skills that stack up to make him unique. He spent a year in the corporate world, has an MBA degree, and is an engineer AND an artist. No one else in the world provides that combination of skills that allows him to create what he does.

What is that combination of skills that make you unique?

Hope isn’t a strategy. Nor is waiting on things to happen 🙂

100% Is Easier Than 98%

… it’s easier to hold to your principles 100% of the time than it is to hold to them 98% of the time.

Going the extra mile than the majority is what differentiates one in a normal distribution.

It is quite easy to get lost in the middle

– Be that mentee who is clear about what they seek to improve

– Be that leader who puts people first in any decision

– Be that interviewee who sends a thank you note to his/her interviewers for their feedback – even if they don’t get the role

– Be that person who does their homework regarding the role before asking for a referral

– Be that intern who spends time understanding not just his role but that of the team

– Be that team member who raises their hand and takes ownership to solve the problem that helps the entire team

Set your personal excellence and integrity boundaries

The boundary — your personal moral line — is powerful because you don’t cross it; if you have justified doing it once, there’s nothing to stop you from doing it again

“Decide what you stand for. And then stand for it all the time.”

— Clayton Christensen, Harvard Business Professor

Or as my dad used to oft say – “If you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything”

Two Women who break stereotypes. One, a Spy.

And Two World Wars between them.

Based on the enthralling historical account of the ‘queen of spies’, French secret agent who went by the Pseudonym, Alice Dubois ended up running a network of 100+ agents

The book takes creative liberty with new characters entwined within this and parallel narratives from 1947 and 1915

I absolutely loved the authenticity and depth in the 1915 characters that are missing in the other.

What a fabulous read for anyone who is interested in historical fiction.

What makes the Metaverse different from a Virtual World – 7 essential ingredients.

Our marketing professor once used an analogy with Second Life during a session

Second life is an online platform that allows people to create an avatar for themselves and have a well, second life in an online virtual world.

“Would you care to have an avatar of your own someday”, he asked us.

I have oft wondered why that really didn’t take off.

While we now hear much said about the metaverse, how does one define the term, and where does one draw a line between a metaverse and, say, just another virtual world? 

a16z highlights 7 essential ingredients to what makes a metaverse vs other virtual platforms

Here is one of the 7 that I found the most interesting.

**#Property** rights – Do we own or rent items online today?

“Most successful video games today make money by selling in-game items, like “skins”, “emotes”, and other digital goods. But people who currently buy in-game items aren’t actually buying items – they’re renting them. As soon as anyone leaves for a different game — or the game in question unilaterally decides to shut down or switch up the rules — players lose access. 

People have grown so accustomed to renting from the centralized services of web2 that the idea of actually owning things — digital objects you can sell, trade, or take elsewhere — often strikes people as odd.

But the digital world ought to obey the same logic as the physical world: when you buy something, you own it. It’s yours.”

True property rights have now been made possible with web 3.0

On that note, would you want to own a digital asset soon someday?

Here is the detailed list of the 7 : <https://future.a16z.com/7-essential-ingredients-of-a-metaverse/>

‘Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza in real life, but in the Metaverse he’s a warrior prince.

Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that’s striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse’

It isn’t an easy read.

Absolutely not. It paints a world so outrageous yet believable.

It takes you through a journey that requires you to stay invested – an unsteady narrative with overwhelming information

It makes Neuromancer seem like a Kindergarten book

A kaleidoscope of a sci-fi nightmare, social criticism and a bereft society, it intrigues me like none other

Sci-fi influences art influences reality

If you are a fan of the genre, as Naval says, make this one of the books you read.

Playing the long game

In my first job, I ended up weeping in the restroom within the first 3 months

My team lead was a stickler for writing good code and rightly so. He added comments like a pro.

The first time he reviewed mine, he edited, formatted and deleted parts of it. He didn’t admonish me for it – just continued to format it while calling out how ‘our code is our legacy’.

As I stood behind his chair looking at him editing comments, I felt such a sheer sense of insufficiency at failing at the task that tears welled up in my eyes.

Now, rather than think of it as an opportunity, I castigated myself for how I should have done better.

We are taught to score marks and top subjects at school, but hardly to take failures as learning opportunities.

I wasn’t used to failing at college and thought it would extend to real life.

The incident seems hilarious now but hindsight is always 20/20 and [Prathap](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s amazing note about careers reminded me of this.

Careers are a marathon and not a sprint.

So if you are having a bad day or have messed up – that’s all right, everyone does.

Confidence doesn’t come from not failing – but by accepting one’s limits, learning each day and playing to your strengths

Something you realise over time 🙂

So chin up and play the long game.

Day 6 – #30daysofWeb3 Learning Challenge

Who will control the software that powers the internet with Web 3.0?

Can decentralisation move the narrative from ‘Don’t be evil’ to ‘Can’t be evil’?

###### **5 key take-aways** 

_Sources below_

#1 Over the 35 years lifespan of the internet, control gradually shifted from the open-source protocols to proprietary services driven by tech companies. This unleashed huge benefits for end users with amazing tech. Albeit, it brought with it concerns around privacy and user control

#2 The growing movement with Blockchain, the author points out, combines the power of centralized services with the community ethos

#3 Could this mean the pendulum could swing back to an internet governed by open community governed services? Something that has precedence with the Android phones running open sourced Linux

#4 “A core insight in the design of blockchains is that the open source model can be extended beyond software to cloud-based services by adding financial incentives to the mix” – something that can be enabled with tokens

#5 What does it mean for the future?

“The emerging technology of crypto and web3 — specifically, programmable blockchains, composable smart contracts, and digital assets — makes it possible for decentralized systems to achieve unprecedented levels of coordination and operational functionality.

This evolution enables new forms of governance and organizations, community-owned-and-operated networks and services, robust economies, and countless other innovations.”

In the next edition, we can dive deeper into the various principles of decentralization

What I learned from 4 months of maintaining a Decision Log?

I maintained a log of all decisions I have taken, the reasons why and how they turned out.

And this is one thing I have learnt

That the decisions that tend to not do exceptionally well are the ones that start with requiring massive changes – in people, process or tech.

While starting with a big bang could be good for enthusiasm, rallying troops towards a common vision and course correct work better with tiny improvements iterated over and over.

Awareness is critical.

If you are looking at improving your decisions, here are 5 ideas to get started

**#1** Start with keeping a log of decisions you take, why and how they have turned out. Identify your actions that caused poor and good decisions.

**#2** Seek feedback from people you work with around things that you should start-stop and continue. For example – I realise I tended to often skip the small talk and get to task solving unless I am conscious about it.

**#3** Identify problem use-cases around areas you want to improve on and talk out aloud/write down scenarios of how you would tackle it. Example – How should you handle working with ambiguity with specific examples.

**#4** Record yourself introducing yourself or explaining something to another person and listen to it. I realise I tend to not just talk fast but also communicate too many things within a single conversation. Something that doesn’t make for impact.

**#5** Talk to people – Learning from people is something I have oft-ignored in lieu of books. This is absolutely game-changing.

Do you have ideas or tips around how you have actively worked on improving decisions?

What is the one thing that makes exceptional leaders?

Earlier in my career, I reached out to a women leader – someone I admired but didn’t know at all.

She chose to make time for someone who wanted to be her.

In my raw ambition, I told her my grand career plans and all that I wanted to do. She smiled and unlike most who found it ridiculous, asked me to ‘tell me more’.

I felt heard.

In retrospective, there is one thing I have consistency noticed exceptional leadership do well

Treat people fairly.

Irrespective of where you come from, what level you are at or what your views are.

Be nice. Be respectful.

Its not about valuing people equally but treating people equitably

“And when you attempt to treat everyone the same, you ignore their uniqueness and minimize their perspective and experience.

You end up devaluing them.

As leaders, we must understand that equality applies to human dignity—all people are created with value; all people deserve to be treated respectfully and with an eye towards human worth.

Equity is different from equality”

Be nice. Be respectful.

It is singularly a massive competitive advantage.

Sleep is the first thing I have compromised on when pushed for time.

Like most folks.

It helped that I can survive with very little of it.

But starting tomorrow, I am getting back to my routine of journalling, meditation, workout and tracking my 7 hours of sleep

So here is to my public **#30DayChallenge** to stick to my morning routine

Seems like a good time to revisit this book review episode from earlier.

Why We Sleep? 3 things you should absolutely know about how sleep impacts your life

**#1** The impact of sleep neglect on health

**#2** What happens when we sleep

**#3** The effect of sleep deprivation on emotional health and weight gain

Why, though it seems time-wasting/unproductive, we still need to get a good night’s sleep to get a long list of physiological, biological, psychological benefits.

I realize now that I sounded like a news-caster and the conveyer of bad news 🙂

Well… one grows, one learns!

Day 5 – #30daysofWeb3 Learning Challenge

Why do people invest in Crypto?

> ‘The smartest and the dumbest people are on Crypto. Wonder what I should take away from that’,

said someone on LinkedIn the other day.

The global crypto market was $2.7T as of late 2021

As with any investment, there are early adopters, naysayers and fence sitters.

Where should you be – depends a lot on how much you know.

**#1Understanding Fiat and Cryptocurrency?**

 Fiat Money is government issued currency as a legal tender that isn’t backed by any commodities such as gold. A good example is most modern paper currencies such as US dollar. Cryptocurrency is digital money that is stored on a blockchain.

**#2How is Crypto different?**

Sending and receiving crypto happens without

* Banks acting as middlemen with an attached fee
* Sans any personal details
* Across the world, to anyone at any time
* In ‘fractional shares’ (as 0.000001 bitcoin for example)

But it does involve

* Paying a fee for the network (Think Ether gas)
* Potentially large fluctuations
* Phishing attempts or scams

Owning crypto can be rollercoster ride – as evidenced in the visual below, there are all time highs and crashes

**#3 Why do people invest in crypto**

As per Odyssey, here are 3 reasons why. Source in comments

* As a long term investing strategy : Bitcoin is the best performing asset class, beating even US NASDAQ 100\. It is the ‘5th largest company’ in the world with a marketcap of $1.2 trillion
* Crypto as a hedge against the financial system – There are three key challenges in the traditional financial system that crypto seeks to offset – Inflation (bitcoin is capped at 21M, governments can always print more currency), Limitations with Banks (fees, compromised personal info etc) and Banking not being available to all ( 1.7 B adults don’t have a bank account across the world)
* It is a utility beyond an investment – In the future, one may need to hold crypto to ‘participate in the economy’

**#4 What are the crypto’s folks buy?**

The top three are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance. There are other stablecoins such as USDC backed by fiat currency held in reserve.

**#5 Where do folks buy crypto from?**

Most do through a centralized exchange such as Binance or Coinbase that handle your wallet and transactions. Odyssey lists out the below as factors to consider when choosing one – Security, Liquidity, Fees, User experience, Customer Support, Crypto selection and regional availability. The experts also choose decentralized exchanges or stock brokerage apps such as Robinhood

Here is some solid advice Odyssey shares on the topic that is worth concluding with –

‘Be careful FOMOing into a new coin. It could go down as fast as it goes up.’

And if you choose to invest, base it on awareness and not on FOMO.

P.S – None of this is investment advise.

5 tips to manage your time as a working parent

How do you manage time is one of the top questions I get.

Especially from working mothers.

My time isn’t mine alone.

You can have a well planned calendar and the kid can throw a fit. There are always things to do, classes to get to or groceries to buy

Here are 5 things I have learnt the hard way that can help

**1) Build your personal schedule and routine. Then one for the family.**

Schedule in every single thing that requires your inputs. I do a running 2 month calendar that is updated weekly along with the family.

**2) Align on outcomes not tasks**

Work out segregation in terms of outcomes with the family – one parent manages everything regarding say, play dates

**3) Agree on boundaries**

Nothing annoys me like context switching – especially when I am in the middle of a pomodoro. Agree on time slots when individuals are unavailable and when they would spend time together.

**4) Seek Help**

Define your dealbreakers. Seek help with everything else.

I am not ok with not having time to read to the kid each day.

I am ok with not being the mother with the best baked cake at school.

**5) Plan to fail**

Things will not go as per plan. So account time for things to fail. Which it will 🙂

Finally, make it fun. We try to gamify the entire thing. There is no one harder in the world to convince than a soon to be 7 year old.

How do you manage your energy and time?

How do I become the CEO?

‘What got you here, won’t get you there’ is a brilliant book on the topic of scaling as a leader.

The idea being, what helped you in your individual contributor journey may not be the same traits that could help you navigate the C suite

So what qualities differentiates a CEO from the rest?

The article talks about three distinct pathways that the most successful C-suite residents tend to leverage.

**#1Fixer** : Being a “fixer.” From an early age, people with this type of capability naturally see how things in their organization could run better. They instinctively rethink systems, processes, and reporting structures — even before they have the authority to change anything.

**#2RelationshipMaven** : Being a “relationship maven.” Leaders with this skill have a natural curiosity about other people, which starts early in their careers. As they progress in their careers and their network of “friends” grows, these leaders instinctively start bringing different people together in rooms to pull off deals and collaborations that get bigger over time — yielding results others have a difficult time replicating.

**#3PassionPlayer** : Being a “passion player.” These leaders believe that accomplishing something significant is what matters, and they use that belief to recruit and motivate others to their cause. They are often deep experts in a particular area, bringing tremendous business knowledge and/or strategic thinking to a particular topic, that helps make the story behind their passion compelling to a broad array of stakeholders.

Maybe you don’t want the CEO title but yearn to make an impact – nonetheless, it sounds like the key is to identify what your natural strengths are and to play towards those pathways. Intentionally.

“People don’t walk into the top spot. They’re driven”

Where do you think your core strengths lie? Do you think you have a combination of these skills?

At times, straddling with all that I want to do feels like jujitsu

Yet, this was an Executive course that was worth the effort

Berkeley Exec Educations’ 8 week immersive online PM studio is one of those courses that justifies the weekends spent on course work

Here are 5 key areas I took away from this course

– Effectively managing a product team

– Product Management canvas and identifying ‘jobs to be done’

– Centering products around the customer experience

– How to build narrative structures to tell great stories

– Creating value, pricing strategies, negotiation tactics and portfolio planning

Most importantly, I love the cohort based courses with coaches – trying in terms of time, but high value in terms of ROI

For my next learning adventure, I am looking at recommendations. Have one you absolutely loved? Drop a message?

**#Day4** – **#30daysofWeb3** Learning Challenge

### Understanding Bitcoin and Ethereum

**#1Bitcoin** 101 : Created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto to be a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system, it is built on blockchain and thus shares the characteristics of being decentralised, immutable and open.

It is also hard-capped (there will be only 21M bitcoin ever) and single-purpose ( a store of value).

**#2** What was the value prop? It was proposed as a solution to the double spending problem using a peer to peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. T

**#3** What is Ethereum

The second most popular crypto currency, it was created in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin to let anyone write “write smart contracts and decentralised applications (dapps)”

**#4** How does it work? Much like BTC, Ethereum is built on blockchain and is decentralised, immutable and open. Unlike BTC though, the goal of Ethereum is to becomes the worlds’ decentralised computer

**#5Understanding** Ethereum 101

Ether – Ethereum;s digital token (store of value such as bitcoin) but its purpose is to reward nodes on the Ethereum blockchain for processing transactions.

Gas – Amount of Ether that’s paid to a node to process a transaction

Smart Contracts – Code that runs on Ethereum blockchain that is decentralised (stored on all nodes in the network), immutable (can’t be changes once committed on blockchain) and open (anyone can view and use it)

Decentralised apps (dapps) combine backend smart contract with front end UI

Ethereum has the largest web3 developer ecosystem thanks to its ‘composability’ – ie, much like legos, anyone can build on an existing smart contract to create something new.

This has results in dapps that power Web 3 that allow for buying and selling NFTs, swapping tokens, lending and borrowing tokens to earning income from playing games

So if you hear gas, remember that it costs a lot in gas to process Ethereum transactions. Tomorrow lets look into learning more around why folks invest in crypto

**#Day3** – **#30daysofWeb3** Learning Challenge

Understanding Blockchain and How Transactions work

**#1** What is a Blockchain?

 ‘A blockchain is a linked list of transactions stored on a network of computers” A shared immutable ledger, if you will.

**#2** What are the defining properties of a Blockchain?

They are ‘Decentralized’ (transactions happen on a network of computers called nodes without a central authority)

They are ‘Immutable’ ( transactions are permanent records – cannot be changed once committed)

They are ‘Open’ (transactions on a blockchain can be viewed by anyone

**#3** How does a Blockchain look?

Think of each block holding a list of transactions, an hash (string of random characters definign the block) and the previous block’s hash

**#4** What is required for a transaction to happen?

If Alice wants to send Bob 1 bitcoin then here is what needs to happen

Both need crypto wallets that story two keys – A public key and a private key

Think of a public key as an address that lets you send and receive transactions. Example – your email id

Think of private key as what proves that you own the tokens associated with the public address. Say – the email password. This is a ‘seed phrase’ and unique and confidential to you

**#5** What are the steps that happen during a transaction?

a. Alice sending Bob a bitcoin goes through three steps

b. Alice tells the wallet Bob tells his wallet: “I want to send 1 bitcoin from my public address to Bob’s public address.” She signs this transaction based on his private key proving her ownership..

Alice’s wallet sends the transaction to nodes on the blockchain. These nodes then verify the transaction using Alice’s signature and public key.

c. A node groups Alice’s transaction with other transactions into a block. It then works with other nodes to add the block to the blockchain.

Only if other nodes agree will the block be added to the blockchain

This requires consensus.

So how does a blockchain process transaction without middlemen?

We will look in more detail into the two consensus mechanisms tomorrow

**#Day2** – **#30daysofWeb3** Learning Challenge

On Ownership and how that is driving the future of software and Digital Economy

**#1** **Why is Ownership the next step in software?**

“Ownership is a powerful motivator for users to contribute to products in deeper ways, be it with ideas, computing resources, code, or community building. … This results in software that is not only built, operated, and funded by individual users—but owned by users too.”

**#2** **Why will it succeed today? Because tech today unlike earlier can enable it**

Any innovation starts with replicating the existing process. Earlier web protocols such as IP, HTTP and RSS created copies of physical systems such as newspapers. This was followed by user published content such as blogs and podcasts.

Today the protocol innovation with tokens brings with it a new model with market driven networks – allowing users to ‘Own a piece of products and services they use’

**#3** **How does crypto drive ownership? How do they manifest to users?**

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the first user-owned and operated networks at scale. It allows for multiple applications centered around users. Example – “startups like Binance and Numerai have leveraged tokens to distribute revenue from the platform directly to their users, fuelling brand loyalty and growth”

**#4** **How will Web 3 change the digital economy?**

“Web3 will change the digital economy by enabling ownership of digital content.” Or through ‘monetizing individuality’ as Andreessen Horowitz puts it.

**#5** **How do you establish ownership of digital content?**

In the physical world, that is in form of a ownership registry – think registering houses.. In the Web 3 world, the underlying database instead of being maintained by a central authority, lies on the blockchain – maintained by a network of computers around the world – with NFTs recording ‘proof of ownership

Now that we understand the what of Web 3 and the Why, lets talk more about the how tomorrow through uncovering Blockchain

> ## Crypto has one feature that has never existed before – trust. – [Ben Horowitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7QdIQVTly0).

I am doing a **#30daysofWeb3** challenge in April.

It is still early in the journey

And the best thing you can do is to get educated.

So here are 5 bullets on Day 1 – Why Web 3.0, Ownership and Tokens

**#1** **Why Web 3.0** : “Crypto has one feature that has never existed before – trust. – Ben Horowitz”

Where are you today relying on trust? On banks to get paid or lawyers to draw up contracts.

**#2** **How will the world be different with Web 3.0 :** Trust implies ownership. “By reducing the middleman tax, people can finally own the upside from their work. Web3 matters because we’re building an internet owned by people instead of middlemen.”

**#3 What does the evolution of web look like?**

Web1: Read | Where we navigated static pages built on http protocols

Web2: Read, write | Most of what today looks like. We create and consume content through web giant platforms sitting in the middle. Based on client-server architecture.

Web3: Read, write, own | Create, consume and own work through tokens. Built on P2P computer networks sans middlemen

**#4 What is a Token?** 

Think of it as a record of ownership of an asset that lives on a blockchain

**#5 What are Fungible or Non-Fungible Tokens?**

Fungible tokens are interchangeable records – think USD or Rupee

Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique crypto tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. Ex – Art.

Think of it as a Non-interchangeable unit of data. It is an Ethereum based asset

Tomorrow we will look at understanding why Web 3.0 matters for users and blockchain – which is foundational to Web 3.0

The Constantly Diminishing Cost of Tech

And how we take it for granted.

I was telling my 6 year old about sifting through Encyclopedias to finish school projects

She turned around and asked – ‘Why didn’t you just ask Alexa, Amma’.

For a moment I recollected the trips to the store to buy floppy disks, the 100 free SMS/day limit I raced to finish and all the times my grand mom made me buy stamps and ask for letters at the post office.

“In the last century we have seen an amazing increase of affordability of a wide variety of goods, including food…. According to Peter Diamandis the average cost of food today is 13 times less than it was a century ago.”

The graphic below shows the cost per kilogram for space launches across the globe since 1960.

Today, a SpaceX rocket launching can be 97% cheaper than a Russian Soyuz ride cost in the ’60s.

So while I am astounded each day with the quality and speed with which I can get stuff delivered home each day – freeing up time for my to do what I love, I am deeply grateful to tech.

Whilst trying hard to ensure that the instant gratification doesn’t make my daughter detached from the joy of anticipation 🙂

“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

If you are a founder, the first stage of creating a network is by far the hardest.

Slack isn’t useful until your colleagues are also on the platform. Uber isn’t useful until there are enough drivers, who won’t drive until there are enough rides.

It is a chicken and egg situation that Andrew Chen calls the ‘Cold Start Problem’ in a book with the same title.

So how do you solve for it? He talks about identifying and building an atomic network, which is a single stable, engaged network that can self-sustain.

Then rinse and repeat

He calls out how this strategy has played our in the largest networks we see around us – from Facebook to Uber and Slack.

It is critical he says to identify what the appropriate atomic network is for each product.

“For Zoom, it’s simply two people that want to video call each other. For Slack, they found it took 3 users to have a stable network. But for Airbnb, it took hundreds of active listings in a given market for a stable network to arise.”

The Cold start theory provides a 5 stage framework that every product team must traverse to fully harness the power of network effects –

**#1** The Cold Start Problem

**#2** Tipping Point

**#3** Escape Velocity

**#4** Hitting the Ceiling

**#5** The Moat

A brilliant primer on Network effects – for anyone who is keen on understanding how networks drive the world around us!

How to compete when you don’t have a winning start?

We shifted into a new neighbourhood when I was in 5th or 6th grade.

Thanks to my mom who worked with the state government, we were eligible to a nice housing quarters that came with a huge jackfruit-trees-laden backyard.

It also happened to be near one of the poshest neighbourhoods in the city.

As Dad and I drove down to the new place, we crossed a tree lined avenue with palatial bungalows and green laws.

I peeked out the window and remarked, ‘Appa, who are these folks ? What do you need to work as to build houses like these?

Its so unfair that they are born to such massive advantage no? How can I compete with them?’

Dad, the always unperturbed one, guffawed out loud.

Don’t compete on what you are different at. Maybe you compete on what all folks have in common’ – Time, Health and Knowledge.

Maybe he made it in jest, but it one of those comments I thought about oft. I call them Levellers.

We are limited all in the time we have – treat it as currency.

Nothing gives more ROI than your investment in sleep and what you eat.

And Technology today is the greatest leveller – you can largely have access to information and people irrespective of where you sit or who you are

Getting past the unfairness of life that is not within our control is critical. Viewing yourself as a victim tends to keep you in the past and promotes a sense of powerlessness.

So here is a reminder to use the levellers to your advantage 🙂

What is the most useful article you have ever read?

[Sequoia Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) did a 39 part series spread out over a couple of years around ‘Data Informed Product Building’

It covers almost everything one can think of around how products evolve, defining product health, frameworks for success to pitfalls in diagnosing health and setting metrics.

It deep-dives into how consumer products such as Facebook drive engagement, how algorithms are designed to what it takes to building a sustainable product.

It finally rounds it off with what it takes to be a data scientist and how one can set and scale data organisations and most importantly make data science work.

The world constantly changes around us. Sometimes, it feels like there is so much to do and learn.

In times of overwhelm, focus on the fundamentals.

And this series does a brilliant job of it. Took me almost a month to get through it.

Highly recommend – whether you are a startup, a leader or an employee who is looking at making a difference.

What happens when AI becomes sentient? Is AI really the evil force driving towards a dystopian future?

“From her place in the store, Klara, an Artificial Friend watches the behavior of those who come in to browse, and of those who pass on the street outside.

Klara remains hopeful that a customer will soon choose her

… she is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans”

Nobel winning author Kazuo Ishiguro explores the theme in his latest book, ‘Klara and the Sun’

Sci-fi essentially is thought experiments of the future – What if scenarios played out – revealing our innermost hopes

And fears

Klara, the artificial friend to a sick girl, narrates the story as she assimilates the world around her beyond what she has been designed to be.

Of humans who are conflicted between treating her between a machine or a person. Feelings she seeks to interpret, observing nuances, conundrum and relationship dynamics that is so uniquely human, that it makes you almost root for her.

Kazuo’s spins up a dystopian future that borders on fantasy – one we co-habit with androids.

It explores the powerful questions we oft ask but don’t get answers to

‘What does it mean to be truly human? What do we miss when our loved ones are no more?

What makes our life worth living? What if the have vs the have nots of the future isn’t based on wealth, geography or caste but by modified genomes.

And finally how far will you go to protect the human who created you?

A beautiful tale – highly recommend if you are even passingly curious about AI.

‘First-level thinking says, “It’s a good company; let’s buy the stock.” Second-level thinking says, “It’s a good company, but everyone thinks it’s a great company, and it’s not. So the stock’s overrated and overpriced; let’s sell.”

First-level thinking says, “I think the company’s earnings will fall; sell.” Second-level thinking says, “I think the company’s earnings will fall less than people expect, and the pleasant surprise will lift the stock; buy.”

First-level thinking is simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it. Second-level thinking is deep, complex and convoluted.

I am reading Howard Marks’ exceptional book on investing, ‘The Most important thing’ where he explains the concept of second-order thinking.

Beyond just investing, even in life, being ‘more right’ requires deeper thinking. Being able to ask “And then what?”, as the FS blog writes on the topic.

Extraordinary performance comes from seeing things that other people can’t see. Have you seen or experienced second order thinking based decisions?

A kind soul summarized wisdom nuggets from 50 years of Warren Buffet’s shareholder letters

Made me go back and look for the letters. Here is something he wrote this year. At 91.

The Orangutan Effect

“If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, you may leave behind a puzzled primate, but will exit thinking more clearly yourself.”

“Teaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts”

Why everyone needs a personal moat to accelerate their career?

One of my favourite newsletters is the Morning Brew

Alex Lieberman, the founder recently did a podcast of the topic of building a personal moat

What is a moat, you ask?

A business moat is a key competitive advantage that sets a company apart from its competitors. Think Apple’s switching costs or Louis Vuitton’s branding

Think of translating that to your careers.

How do you find a mix that creates a massive unlock in your career?

Here is a summary

1) Build social currency – Not the 30 under 30 temporary awards, network, reputation, and brand that is accumulated from demonstrating specific knowledge or skills for a long period of time

2) T shaped person – Going deep : “If you’re going to become an expert around something, truly do”. Build skills that cannot be easily outsourced or commoditised.

3) Build specific skills – He calls out 4 of them :

– Engineering and speaking the language of tech

– Content creation and audience building

– Critical thinking

– EQ

4) How do you choose knowledge areas : Choose ones that deeply interest you. And those that will be big in 5/10 years from now. I completely resonate with the ones he calls out – Web3 and crypto, fintech, health tech, the creator economy, and sustainable businesses.

All of this doesn’t need one to start a business. You could try becoming the indispensable employee.

How do you look at building personal moats?

[Morgan Housel](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) asks brilliant questions.

In his blog, he recently asked 6 questions.

Ones that make you ponder over them. And learn something about yourself.

The one that caught my fancy the most is – “What have you changed your mind about in the last decade?”

The writer Derek Thomson, to whom the question was asked, make the astute observation that as education changes the way middle class thinks about the society, the cultural wars used my politicians may no longer work.

For me, there are so many things. Sometimes, I feel like a different person now that I was a decade ago.

I have been a Type A personality, wanting to do it all and positively impact the world. If there is one thing that I have learnt over the last decade, it is this –

“Go slow to go fast”.

“What have you changed your mind about in the last decade?”

A willowy 21 year old stood at bus stop one evening. As the light faded, so did her confidence. She couldn’t see a single woman on the road. It was 1980 and women didn’t venture out of homes unaccompanied at 7PM. She tugged her bag closer. Finally she breathed a sigh of relief as she saw the light of the bus roll towards her.

‘You know you don’t need to work. You could always stop’, grandpa told her gently. ‘No, I want to. I will look for a different job where I could leave earlier’, mom was stubborn. Grandpa gave in – she was the first woman in the family to graduate and he wanted to ensure he gave her a choice. One that he was berated for continuously by his family. ‘Why don’t you get her married off, instead”. But he persisted.

Thanks to her stellar academics, she got a role with the state government. One that had better perks and working hours but where she had to travel for more than 2 hours each day.

“I’ll manage”, she said. And she did. Switching 3 buses each way to get to her workplace at the other end of the town.

Back from work, she cooked us hot meals each day while dad helped us with homework.

She did this for 30 years, choosing to put herself through the discomfort rather than have her kids miss out on good schools or being close to their grandparents. She steadily grew at her role retiring as a gazetted officer with the state department.

‘Be independent. You may have a trust fund, or you may have a wealthy spouse, you never know when either one will run out’ – Sunscreen song.

That is in line with what she told me oft growing up, making me do her taxes each year from when I turned 15.

On this women’s day, as we talk about **#breakingthebias**, please take a moment to acknowledge all the men and women who have broken barriers for us to stand here today.

Here is to an equal playing field and a future. Here is hoping my daughter doesn’t require a day/month to remind her of how far she has come and the shoulders she stands on 🙂

Play the odds to your favour. Always.

There are a handful of messages I get from strangers on LinkedIn each day.

A majority of them drop a Hi and leave it at that. Others ask for what open roles are present in analytics. Some ask for how they can find a job. Some don’t follow-through on threads they initiate.

Only around 1 % of them take the effort to look at the careers page, review their skillset against relevant roles and ask specific questions.

“Here is the research I have done. These are the most suitable roles I have found. Here are the gaps that I see that I am working towards. Do you see them as dealbreakers? If not, could you refer me to them?”

9 out of 10 times I refer them to it.

Increasing your luck involves doing what the majority aren’t doing. Over and over.

In life, play the odds to your favour. Intentionally.

Why sometimes you need lead bullets.

“Early in my tenure as product manager for the web servers at Netscape, we faced a terrible crisis.

We just got our hands on Microsoft’s new web server, Internet Information Server (IIS), and benchmarked against our product.

Microsoft’s IIS had every feature that we had, was five times faster and we knew that they were going to give it away for free.

This might not sound so bad, but we had just gone public three months earlier with a story to Wall Street that said, “Don’t worry about Microsoft giving away the browser because we will make money selling servers.”

I immediately went to work trying to move the playing field and pivot the server product line to something that we could sell for money.

As I excitedly reviewed the plan with my engineering counterpart, Bill Turpin, he looked at me as though I was a little kid who had much to learn. Bill was a long-time veteran of battling Microsoft from his time at Borland and understood what I was trying to do, but remained unconvinced. He said: “Ben, those silver bullets that you and Mike are looking for are fine and good, but our web server is five times slower. There is no silver bullet that’s going to fix that. No, we are going to have to use a lot of lead bullets.”

As a result of Bill’s words, we focused our engineering team on fixing the performance issues while working the other things in the background.

We eventually beat Microsoft’s performance and grew the server line to become a $400M business and we would never have done it without those lead bullets”

Ben Horowitz narrates this incident in his book ‘Hard thing about Hard things’.

His point and advice to entrepreneurs is simple – “There comes a time in every company’s life where it must fight for its life. If you find yourself running when you should be fighting, you need to ask yourself: “If our company isn’t good enough to win, then do we need to exist at all?””

I think it rings true in our life too. Are you running away or are you standing up to fight.

AI singularity refers to an event where the AI either become self aware, or reach an ability for continuous improvement so powerful that it will evolve beyond our control’

It may be a far way out but one ponders about whether there will be a human advantage in a world disrupted by artificial intelligence?

That is the question that this book seeks to address. The question then is – “what uniquely human traits can help us deal with the challenges of the future and harness technology to our advantage”

Framing

“To frame is to make a mental model that enables us to see patterns, predict how things will unfold, and make sense of new situations.

Frames guide the decisions we make and the results we attain. Science has long focused on traits like memory and reasoning leaving framing all but ignored.

But with computers becoming better at some of those cognitive tasks, framing stands out as a critical function–and only humans can do it. This book is the first guide to mastering this innate human ability”

On that note, so many books, so little time. In an alternate universe, I might choose to be a librarian

Give this a read if the topic interests you.

You can be a woman, be ambitious about your career and be unapologetic about it!

Who do so many girls top their classes at school and college and yet so few remain in the workforce a decade later.

What results in women dropping out of the workforce before they reach management positions?

A McKinsey report called it the “broken rung”

“Yet even as more women reach senior management, too many are still getting stuck in entry-level jobs—”the broken rung” phenomenon.

Top-level female execs may be cracking the glass ceiling, but overall women are less likely to be promoted to or hired for leadership roles. With 72 women promoted to management for every 100 men, and men holding 62 percent of manager-level jobs, women simply can’t catch up”

There is no single reason why this happens.

I am privileged to be part of an organisation that considers diversity as not just the right thing to do but one that heralds us into a better future with diverse perspectives.

I have benefited tremendously from mentors and continue to do so. Its my personal goal hence to pay it forth and help more women overcome the ‘broken rung’.

This month thus, I signed up pro-bono to mentor women looking at getting into leadership positions in tech and entrepreneurship on Women’ Global Mentoring program in STEM and Kerala’s Startup Mission.

If you are a woman in tech looking to move into management positions and struggling with it, share you inputs on what is holding you back.

Let’s work not just in getting women back to work. But also in leadership roles.

One of my friends’ lost a parent a long time ago. He was miserable for months, understandably so.

I was quite young and honestly was at a loss of how to communicate or help with grief. I thought my role as a friend was to cheer him up and kept offering ideas that could help him.

Until he turned around and said, ‘Can you stop offering solutions to fix me. Sometimes, I just want to be heard’.

For some reason, that incident has defined empathy. It is an under utilised super power.

We tend to have this huge action bias. We tend to form responses in our heads even as the other person is speaking. We like solving for problems, offering ideas and ways in which the other person can do better.

But sometimes, people just want to be heard. They want to talk it out. Without being trivialised.

A friend does this brilliantly. His most favourite question is ‘Tell me more about it’

Leadership is about empathy. At home and at work.

“When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen.”

— Ernest Hemingway

“Our genes are a predisposition, but our genes are not our fate”

‘Health’ and how can we live better – that is the theme of books I am reading this month.

This is one of those best sellers that I have been meaning to read since I switched to a Whole Plant based diet last November.

Dr Dean Ornish is a pioneer of lifestyle medicine and uses studies to show that lifestyle changes are often actually better than drugs and surgery in treating and even reversing many of the most prevalent chronic diseases.

The premise is simple. He has 4 steps as part of his health program  
#1 Eat well: a whole foods, plant-based diet naturally low in fat and sugar and high in flavor.  
#2 Move more: moderate exercise such as walking  
#3 Stress less: including meditation and gentle yoga practices  
#4 Love more: how love and intimacy transform loneliness into healing  
The “Ornish diet” has been rated “#1 for Heart Health” by U.S. News & World Report every year from 2011 to 2017\.   
Dr Ornish’s take that the medical fraternity has been focussed on curing symptoms with drugs and very rarely do they focus on root-cause which is driven by nutrition.

Yes, there are views to the contrary but the book is backed with research and findings that is quite worth a read.

While I would refrain from providing recommendations since it involves health, personally I have benefitted tremendously with a switch to a whole foods diet. Not to mention losing 10 Kilos in 3 months.  
Please make diet changes only after consulting your physician.

Do you have book recommendations I can add to the Health theme?

“The world isn’t fair, Calvin”

“I know. But why isn’t it ever unfair in my favour”

It is one of my favourite Calvin and Hobbes strips all time.

I was once having a conversation with a mentor. “But it just isn’t fair. We deserve better”, I called out vehemently.

“Do you want to vent or find solutions?” he smiled at me. That’s one thing you learn to be clear about when you have coaching conversations.

The other thing he mentioned was this, ‘Expect positive results but prepare for the world to be unfair and to fail”

There are always going to be things beyond your control. The dissonance we have in our heads is with the discrepancy between our perceived sense of right vs the reality.

Yes, life can be unfair.

For the longest time, I hated seeing people older than 60\. In my head, my dad didn’t get to live beyond 62 for no fault of his. It seemed quite unfair to see folks with unhealthy lifestyles live much longer. But that is not the right kind of thinking.

But on the flip side, it is also unfair that I was born to parents who valued and educated me as well as they did their son. Something I choose to take for granted.

Getting past the unfairness of life that is not within our control is critical. Viewing yourself as a victim tends to keep you in the past and promotes a sense of powerlessness.

One of the things I have learnt to do over time is to plan for things not to go in my favor. Be cognisant of what you can and cannot control. And do not expend energy on things that are beyond you.

4 categories of Moats that drive the biggest companies

A business moat is a key competitive advantage that sets a company apart from its competitors.

It is what keeps has helped the biggest companies build and defend their markets

From Amazon and Tesla to Starbucks and Coinbase, here are the common types of moats.

**#1** Network Effects – The more users it has, the more useful it gets. Think marketplace, social networks, data and platform.

**#2** Cost Moats – Think switching costs, sunk costs and cost advantages (ex – Walmart)

**#3** Cultural Moats – Brand and what it stands for. Patagonia is a cult favorite in this category

**#4** Resource Moats – Think IP, Knowledge or regulatory. Healthcare, Financial services and Crypto benefit hugely here,

Here is one of my favorite – own the platform, own the network

Example – Tesla has built a complex ecosystem of products that reinforce each other’s value, creating a moat out of platform network effects. The moat has electric vehicles at its core. But the company has also built advanced software, offers a charging network, and sells complementary products like in-home energy storage and solar roofs.

For instance, Tesla has also built over 25,000 supercharger stations around the world that Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas considers as a major strategic asset:

The next time you come across a new company think of which of these they operate and use. Do you have any favorites?

How do NFTs’ create value?

Or simply put – why does anyone pay for a digital piece of art that can be freely downloaded. Who pays for pixels?

With working parents, I was raised mostly by my (very financially prudent) grandmother, who looked at ROI on everything she spent.

Being widowed quite early, she was quite astute in how she managed finances. She had to, in order to run a household with 8 kids on a measly pension.

So my first question was, why would/should someone pay for an NFT? “How much could a cluster of pixels possibly be worth?

More pointedly, why is it worth anything at all?”

Here is what I have learned and what you should know. Spend 15 mins this weekend, to learn 5 reasons why?

> “In March 2021, a work of art called **Everydays: The First 5000 Days** sold for **$69 million at Christie’s Auction House”**

“It’s not out of the ordinary to see eight-figure art sales, but this one received a lot of attention because the piece was sold as a non-fungible token (NFT) – an electronic record corresponding to an image that lives entirely in the digital world.

> **Put differently: Someone paid almost $70 million for a picture on the internet”**

It is not just a digital record of transactions,

> “Blockchains are [programmable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/10/08/programmable-blockchains-how-nfts-are-driving-the-future-of-art-music-and-play/?sh=2afb7f4f1c4c), it’s possible to endow NFTs with features that enable them to expand their purpose over time, or even to provide direct utility to their holders. In other words, NFTs can do things — or let their owners do things — in both digital spaces and the physical world”

#### Real Life Use Cases

1. **How Creators can expand on their product ecosystem with their fans by granting additional tokens** : “owners of a particular [goat NFT](https://maisondegoat.com/the-lounge), for example, were recently able to claim a free [baby goat NFT](https://twitter.com/MaisonDeGOAT/status/1451164980955467781) that gives [benefits beyond the original token](https://maisondegoat.com/KIDz); holders of a particular [bear NFT](https://www.twobitbears.com/), meanwhile, just received [honey](https://mobile.twitter.com/TwoBitBears/status/1456076824291823618).
2. How folks can build properties on top of “their NFTs that can grow value of the overall brand” – “The [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/), for example, comprises a series of NFT ape images conferring membership in an online community. The project started with a series of private chat rooms and a graffiti board, and has grown to include high-end merchandise, social events, and even an actual [yacht party](https://www.theboredapegazette.com/post/ape-fest-begins-tomorrow-here-s-what-you-need-to-know). [SupDucks](https://supducks.com/) and the [Gutter Cat Gang](https://guttercatgang.com/) similarly began building communities around NFT image series and associated online spaces; the former has bridged into a boardwalk-themed [metaverse game](https://medium.com/supducks/the-weekly-ish-supdate-5-b0814e6b1c38), and the latter has focused on real-world benefits like [extravagant in-person events](https://guttercatgang.com/guttercon-2021/).”
3. **Blending online ownership with offline use cases** – ‘A few restaurants, for example, have [started using](https://medium.com/uptick-network/uptick-app-the-maya-story-a13fc1b23e87) NFTs for reservations’. ‘companies are exploring how NFTs could be used in establishing and recording people’s identity and reputation online. MIT recently started offering blockchain-based [digital diplomas](https://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-debuts-secure-digital-diploma-using-bitcoin-blockchain-technology-1017), which are effectively non-transferable NFTs’

So what is the logic here of how and when they create value.

Here are 5 reasons why –

1. **What are NFTs** – _Non-fungible tokens_ are a unique one-of-its-kind digital item. They are stored on public-facing digital ledgers called ‘blockchains’ (check out this video on ‘Explain Blockchain like I am a 5 year old’). What this means is that you can trace the lineage of ownership of NFTs across time. Alice sold it to Bob who sold it to Cathy who now holds it, for example.
2. **Easy transfer of ownership** – If you have done money transactions from one account to another, online, this is no different. Transferring ownership is similar to how ‘banks move money across accounts’. It is very hard to counterfeit them.
3. **Verifiable Digital Ownership and driving a new market that didn’t exist**: We have never to date, had a way of identifying ‘ownership’ of digital assets. Markets cannot exist or operate without the clarity of an owner and a buyer. This is where NFT’s come in. They provide a means of allowing folks to agree on ownership. What does this create? It makes possible new markets around ‘new types of transactions – buying and selling products that never be sold before”
4. **Be more than a digital record of deeds** – So by now, you are probably thinking, ‘ok, so it’s like a digital deed or record of transactions that cannot be counterfeited”. Yes, it is that and more. “blockchains are [programmable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/10/08/programmable-blockchains-how-nfts-are-driving-the-future-of-art-music-and-play/?sh=2afb7f4f1c4c), it’s possible to endow NFTs with features that enable them to expand their purpose over time, or even to provide direct utility to their holders. In other words, NFTs can do things — or let their owners do things — in both digital spaces and the physical world”
5. **How can it be more than ownership? What can you program NFTs into?** Think membership or loyalty cards Tickets, access to events, creators using it to interact with their fans to gamify, add special discounts, and **‘serve as digital keys to online spaces where holders can engage with each other**‘. As the HBR article states, ‘it’s even possible to send additional products directly to anyone who owns a given token’. As I recall from a podcast I was listening to, this allows creators to engage and build their communities around their personal brands. The programmability has also allowed for “[royalty](https://hbr.org/2017/03/blockchain-could-help-artists-profit-more-from-their-creative-works) [contract](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981), whereby each time a work is resold, a share of the transaction goes back to the original creator.”
6. NFTs be faster in adoption vs Cryptocurrency as a ‘medium of exchange of value’ – “NFT-based markets can emerge and gain traction quickly, especially relative to other crypto products. This is both because the NFTs themselves have standalone value — you might buy an [art](https://www.infinites.ai/) [NFT](https://gradis.art/) simply because [you like it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2021/09/08/the-nft-generative-art-movement-is-challenging-how-we-think-about-value/) — and because NFTs just need to establish value among a community of potential owners (which can be relatively small), whereas cryptocurrencies [need wide acceptance](https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/bitcoin-and-new-digital-ledger-applications-by-christian-catalini-et-al-2021-04) in order to become useful as a store of value and/or medium of exchange”
7. As with everything, what are the unique challenges of this space? Direct applications are around digital rights management. But it makes little sense to use it for ‘managing physical collectibles’. It also has to leverage a community of users to drive value. Essentially, you need early adopters and users to provide it value. ‘Lack of engagement can then become a self-fulfilling prophecy, devaluing the NFTs themselves.’

**This is not a championing of the technology – no, you shouldn’t invest in one that you don’t understand.**

**But awareness and knowledge are power.**

And something from the [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2021/11/how-nfts-create-value) on which this is based, made for a great concluding remark – ‘In the long run, the market will need to contend with the transaction and environmental costs currently associated with using crypto technology.

We will also need to establish more explicit legal frameworks around NFT ownership, and clarify how NFTs relate to existing forms of ownership rights — especially around intellectual property.

At the same time, it’s likely that the most valuable applications of NFTs haven’t even been envisioned yet.”

How do you think the Metaverse will evolve?

Someone had a poll on a superpower to have. It included being able to eat as much as wants or fly or read minds.

I honestly think tech could enable each of those within a century.

More interestingly, the superpower I would love to have is to have a peek into the future decade – much like Marty McFly.

Not so much to change the course but out of sheer curiosity.

An interview called out Satya Nadella’s vision for Metaverse at Microsoft where he said, “Just like the first wave of the internet allowed everybody to build a website, I think the next wave of the internet will be a more open world where people can build their own metaverse worlds, whether they’re organizations or game developers or anyone else.”

‘Even though Meta/Facebook is trying to convince the world that social networking is the most natural on-ramp to the metaverse, it could just as easily be gaming instead’ says the Fast company [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90716389/microsoft-activision-metaverse) on the topic

Do you have resources to recommend on metaverse?

“When the Black Death plague entered England in 1348, the Scots up north laughed at their good fortune.

With the English crippled by disease, now was a perfect time for Scotland to stage an attack on its neighbor.

The Scots huddled together thousands of troops in preparation for battle. Which, of course, is the worst possible move during a pandemic.

“Before they could move, the savage mortality fell upon them too, scattering some in death and the rest in panic”

There’s a powerful urge to think risk is something that happens to other people.

Other people get unlucky, other people make dumb decisions, other people get swayed by the seduction of greed and fear.

But you? 

Me?

No, never us.

Some are more susceptible to risk than others, but no one is exempt from being humbled.”

– A Few Good Stories, Morgan Housel

A great example is in investment decisions – we tend to slot risks against everyone else apart from ourselves.

Explains the IPO prices and the drop thereof.

Do you have other instances?

What employee ‘mindset’ can help organizations and individuals thrive?

Success in the Knowledge economy vs in the Industrial era requires organizations need to be nimble and react quickly when necessary.

Permanent flexibility requires a culture of constant learning.

HBR terms them as ‘Gig Mindsetters’ – “a bold new breed of full-time, salaried employees who think and act like freelancers — self-manage, take spontaneous initiative, focus on skills more than roles, feel free to shortcut processes, and don’t hesitate to question the status quo”

These are folks who share what they learn with others, take ownership of their own personal growth, and feel confident in their ability to influence people.

The article discusses two companies that cultivated gig mindset learning cultures and how they did this. Link – [HBR](https://hbr.org/2022/01/how-workers-with-a-gig-mindset-can-help-your-company-thrive)

Are there people who have helped you, you haven’t thanked?

I had no offers on Day 0 of my MBA placements.

Zilch on Day 1.

By Day 2, I was inconsolable.

FMCG’s thought I was had too much of a tech experience. Marketing thought I wasn’t creative enough.

And I didn’t take failure too well.

After Engineering, I had 4 offers before I joined Oracle. And for some silly reason, I attributed my value to how others perceived me or how much I scored.

‘I am a silver medalist, yet I cannot seem to convert one offer’, I whined to my then fiancé, now husband (who poor thing, must have wondered if this is what arranged marriages meant).

So while I sat dispirited in my hostel room, one of my batchmates from the placement committee, walked in to remind me to try again. And that no one apart from myself was judging.

And I did get through that one.

And in hindsight, yes, I am not creative enough for Marketing and still do not have passion for FMCG as much as I do for Tech. So in retrospect, I am quite glad for how things turned out.

I recalled this when I was writing my gratitude journal this morning.

I don’t think I have ever thanked her for it.

So thank you, [Sonam B Vij](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#). For not giving up on me. When I almost did.

And if you are where I was, remember the rule of 10-10-10

Think not only about how you feel in the moment, but also ten minutes, ten months, and ten years from now. Then decide.

If it isn’t something that you would be ashamed about 10 years from now – don’t let it kill you today.

Let’s see if we can use an analogy here.

We all need a shiny new car. One that accelerates to 60mph in 6 seconds. Why not add IoT – automatic alerts while at it too.

Voice assistant enabled chargers, anyone?…….

No one – Do we have the requisite people, process, and tech for this car to actually run?

The analyst – You know what, this tire up in the front left – doesn’t seem to match with the one on the right.

Good data is a hygiene factor. Much like one’s salary.

You don’t stay at a job for the pay alone but the absence of it will lead to impacting satisfaction and performance.

Investing in a good data strategy AND implementation is foundational to driving any success and winning with AI.

“Invest in AI talent, data, and process change in addition to (and often more so than) AI technology.

Companies that do well, recognize that AI is not all about technology.”

“If you were a known commercial brand, Which one would you be? What 3 adjectives would you use to describe the brand? Who would be the primary customer type? What would be its differential value?”  
  
Each of us asked folks from our professional and personal circles to answer these questions. Post which we reflected on the ‘Brand” we project.  
And most importantly, is this perceived ‘Brand’ close to your ‘desired one’  
  
So I am quite curious about what the LinkedIn community would have to say to these questions.  
Which one would I be? What 3 adjectives would you use to describe my brand?  
\[Feel free to DM\]  
  
(On a related note, it is a worthwhile exercise for all of us to do at some point in time. For whether you do it intentionally or otherwise, you are always projecting ‘brand you’!)

Twenty years ago, MIT Technology Review picked 10 emerging areas of innovation that we promised would “change the world.”

This list marks 20 years since they began compiling an annual selection of the year’s most important technologies.

As the article puts it, quite eloquently, the list “taken together, we believe this list represents a glimpse into our collective future”

Something is refreshing about talking to students as opposed to at industry events.

It’s probably the untapped potential, eagerness to see their future, or a canvas unmuddied by the baggage we build over the years.

Or maybe just that I see my daughter in their enthusiasm.

Not to mention the fabulous co-panelists and moderator 🙂

“I want to be very wealthy when I grow up”

Dad looked up, bemused, “But why, Ammu?’

“Every year since 1982, Forbes magazine has published a list of the richest Americans.

If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences.

In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the 100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor.

By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.

The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more people are making them.

How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56 derive from founders’ or early employees’ equity (52 founders, 2 early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing investment funds.

By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes called “tech” companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive from such companies. These are particularly common among the richest of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of this type.” – Extract from Paul Graham’s essay, How People Get Rich Now.

Wealth, according to my middle class, government salaried parents meant that it was most probably acquired by dubious means.

And as a culture, aspiration was meant for life’s higher ideals, not baser, material things.

And it was plain greedy to wish for more of something. Something someone has less of.

What technology has driven today though is how wealth creation can be moral.

That founders and organizations can act with integrity, and create true value and impact.

Probably now, if he were around, I could tell him this, ‘You will have always have dubious folks across generations. But you will also have people who do it because more of something can also create value and impact across the world. You can make the pie bigger and do it with integrity that will make you proud. And most importantly, life isn’t a zero-sum game”

“You are so ‘lucky’ to have such a helpful spouse. You should teach him how to change napkins too”, piped in a relative, 2 weeks after I had my kid.

“I don’t think the childbirth included a manual that taught me how to change one and missed my husband’, I retorted. Much to my mom’s chagrin.

Yes, stats in this video is glaring, ‘71% of women in India sleep less than their husbands due to household chores.’.

But it isn’t just the physical tasks that drain working women.

Its honestly is the mental load.

Nonetheless, a large portion of the mental load – from planning play dates to organizing school work – in childcare, tends to fall on the mother.

The sheer number of things that are top of mind in terms of things to get done – at work, home, groceries, finances, passions, and for the kid is overwhelming at times.

So if you are a woman who looks at her career, her motherhood, her goals, and her role in the household as equally important identities, then it is a constant battle.

I wouldn’t be surprised if more women give up their passions. Not just their careers, in this pandemic.

The mental load driven by generations of social conditioning carried by women in running a household is tremendous. I can’t even understate how much more this has impacted us during the pandemic

The most precious commodity of it most working women is probably – TIME.

And hopefully, this gets better with time too 🙂

@naval – “I have this theory that 99% of work that you do is useless. You still have to do it because it’s iterating your way to the 1% that is useful. But, in an ideal world, if you are omniscient, you would just cut to the 1%.”

“99% of the stuff you learned at school you have forgotten or curious about, doesn’t really apply to your life anymore.

Now of course you had to do that to build up the expertise for the 1% that worked. Or perhaps do the trial and error to do the 1% that worked.

But as you get older, you get better at figuring it out. So instead of taking 100 shots for a goal, you start taking 10 or 20.

The ability to say no and to be correct that that was a no is a Superpower”

These were notes from Naval from one of his short clips.

And to all the students who constantly ask, what should I do within my life. That is my answer – work to earn that superpower.

And when you earn it, learn to use it 🙂

My sweet mom, who worked and retired at a government job for 35 odd years, once asked, “Ammu, all these unicorns you keep talking about – do they actually make 1Bn rupees of money?’

“It’s valued in USD, amma, not INR”, I replied.

“Oh!’, she exclaimed and then started to multiply with 75, as just moms can do 🙂

There were Unicorns (valued at US $1 Billion), Decacorns (>US $10 Billion), and now ‘Soonicorns’

MINT listed 22 startups that are waiting to become unicorns in 2022 in India (VC circle report) as ‘soonicorns’ ( Raised >500 million, but less than $1billion). The country is projected to have more than 100 unicorns in the next couple of years.

Which one of these is your bet on?

Spent the morning being part of something that is a huge passion –

speaking at [WE Hub, A Government of Telangana Initiative](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) at their ‘Data Science for students’ Program for – mentoring young girls in STEM.

WE Hub is India’s First State-led incubator to foster Women Entrepreneurs, Urban Entrepreneurship and Social/ Impact Entrepreneurship

The program was launched in the presence of the Hon’ble Minister for IT E C, Govt. of Telangana, in June 2021 

Through this program, WE Hub aims to reach 100 girl students across 5 states in India to actively think about solutions to real-world problems which can create an impact on the environment and society.

Love the state-led focus on trainer trainers and bringing in young girls in this space!

More power to all of you young women and for working towards an equal playing field!

Don’t set goals for 2022!

Set Systems instead

The man behind the Dilbert series, Scott Adams puts his success down to an alternative approach to goal setting.

Setting systems vs goals

“The Problem with goals is that they give you something to work toward, but accomplishments are fleeting.

What’s more, if the goal is particularly difficult to achieve, working on it without seeing tangible progress induces feelings of stress. You also might not be able to control the outcome of a goal.

For example, an executive could set a goal of becoming a manager within a business only for the company to rearrange itself due to financial cutbacks and reduce the number of managerial roles.

This puts achieving the goal in question beyond the executive’s reach, at least in the short- and medium-term.”

Systems are a lot like habits in that they represent things you do consistently.

Example

Goal: Lose weight.

System: Run for 30 minutes a day at 7 AM, buy smaller plates, and drink 64 oz of water each day.

Goal: Read 50 books per year.

System: Spend one hour reading each night before bed….

Focus on the process. Results will follow.

“Stop comparing your inside view with someone else’ outside”

I was listening to Omer Khan’s SaaS podcast featuring ThoughtExchange’s CEO, Dave Macleod.

Dave had once stopped reading Tech Crunch. Why?

To avoid seeing fabulous stories of IPO’s and Funding rounds when his company was still trying to get a grapple on their customer segment.

You never know why the company is raising rounds or what their health is. All that we see is a success from an external lens.’

He called out how we tend to compare all the knowledge of our environment (inside view) with what we think is a success as viewed from outside…

It was reminded me of how we do that each day of our lives. Compare notes between where and what we are, with flashy pictures from social media feeds.

I’d think it’s quite human a trait – not something one can completely do away with.

Albeit, something we can be conscious about this new year.

The Ugly Baby and the Beast.  
Innovation drives growth. Run-the-business, the bottom-line.  
So, what should you focus on?  
  
One of the conundrum’s leaders face is ‘how do we balance innovation with driving business value’?  
  
We all know the very famous founder of Pixar – Steve Jobs but we might not have heard of the co-founder, Ed Catmull.  
  
One of his stories in his book Creativity Inc. is the Ugly baby and the Beast  
  
“Early on, all of our movies suck”.- Pixar ﬁlms are not good at ﬁrst \[ugly babies\], and our job is to make them so—to go, as I say, ‘from suck to not-suck.’”  
  
He describes how companies often don’t spend enough time nurturing and improving an initial idea and quickly produce something lacking because of the pressure to “feed the hungry beast.”  
A beast is the business as usual that makes money and it is one that’s got to be fed.  
  
And that is our reality – that the new ideas are fragile, they don’t look good, they take protection, you cannot judge them at that point.  
  
Of course you can’t protect the baby forever. At some point, it has to grow up and change into something because sometimes the ugly baby would rather play in the sandbox forever.  
  
That is a great analogy to the work we do in this space.  
  
The innovative ideas though are like ugly babies and need people to champion and protect them.  
And in the meantime, one ought to feed the beast and drive business value.  
  
How do you balance the ugly baby and the beast?

I receive at least a couple of DMs each week from young women.

Smart, competent women battling imposter syndrome.

“I don’t feel confident enough to ask for the role…. what if folks judge me… why will anyone listen to me… what if they say no…”

Tell you what, I struggle with it all the time. Everyone does.

I have stated this before and I will reiterate this again – the 5C’s for young women out there

**#1Connect** – It is critical to put yourself out there – showcase your capabilities and connect with others who can help charter your career path. Nurture your network – and not just when you need it.

**#2Constantly** Learn – We live in a remote first, knowledge economy. The only way to stay relevant is to constantly work towards staying relevant. Identify your purpose and work towards staying true to it.

**#3Courage** – There is plenty of research that talks about how women are less likely to ask for a referral or a raise. It is important to have a voice and speak up for yourself.

**#4Call** for help – We need to ask for help and support. Build a support system at home. Reach out and get mentors. And most importantly, help other women. We need to help each other.

**#5Confidence** to dream big and believe in yourself – Most women I speak to, do not necessarily have a skill gap but a lack of confidence to walk the path they seek – for fear of failure.

Dream big, be open to fail, to learn and move ahead!

“2020 for web3 was the year 2000 in internet terms” in terms of user growth.

Web3 is “group of technologies that encompasses blockchain, cryptographic protocols, digital assets, decentralized finance and social platforms, NFTs, and DAOs—is the third generation of the internet”

This A16z report makes some great points about the future we are headed, role of policy makers and the role we want technology to play in open societies

– In decentralized systems, value accrues to the platform and its users rather than intermediaries.

– The idea of creating basic building blocks is called “composability” and it is one of the biggest drivers of innovation in web3.

Because web3 systems are open and permission less, anyone can interact with them, integrate, combine, or build on top of them. Composability increases competition and leads to more and better choices for consumers

It’s an opportunity for a reset that allows us to obtain new benefits, while solving some of the thorniest problems arising out of the disruptive technologies of the past

So can web3 as a force for good?

The good news is that technology will be what we make it.

Reflecting on the year that is past, I was thinking about all that I wish to be in the year to come.

Not goals, but the person I want to be, the people I want to meet, the things I want to make, ‘dreaming dangerously and outrageously’ and the unknowns I want to step into, even if I am faking it.

Like Neil Gaiman says, ‘Try to make your time matter: minutes and hours and days and weeks can blow away like dead leaves, with nothing to show but time you spent not quite ever doing things, or time you spent waiting to begin.’

Who is it that you want to be in the new year?

Trust. Web 3.0\. Metaverse and the Future of Human Race

A Thread – Part 1

**#1** If you think about it deeply, co-operation is the basis of the rise of human civilization.

**#2** As nomadic hunter-gatherers, our trust to watch out for each other was primarily social. Over time, this translated into ‘institutional trust’. Think temple, churches, governments an finally co-operations – this is still our predominant model.

Collapses and peppered financial crises has questioned the gatekeepers of trust – can we do any better?

**#3** Can the new paradigm of trust be… programmable? Enabled by software and based on a fundamental entity beyond the authority of an institution..

One where all network users and operators are required to follow the same set of hardcoded rules, known as consensus protocols.

Can there be an open source of internet and trust?

Stay tuned for more of the series

It is said that 60% of new oil paintings worldwide was produced here. The workers in Dafen – while diligent and talented aren’t artists – they are painters.

Cogs in a painting machine.

Seth talks about 2 paintings he owns from Dafen for 60 USD each. Who knows which Dafen resident painted them – no one.

Who cares – no one. The painters are replaceable.

This is becoming more essential in order to survive in the workplace because the days of being a cog in the wheel are over both for ourselves and the teams we lead.

The job is what you do when you are told what to do – it is following instructions and meeting specifications.

Someone can always do it better and cheaper.

Your art is what you do when no one can tell you exactly how to do it? Do you go above your job description to connect the dots by taking responsibility?

Are you challenging the status quo and making things better.

Be an artist not a painter

‘In one of Stephen King’s greatest books, 11/22/63, a young man named Jake discovers a time travel portal which leads back to 1958.

Jake deduces that altering history is possible. However long he stays in the past, only two minutes go by in the present.

He decides to live in the past until 1963 so he can prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, believing that this change will greatly benefit humanity.

After years of stalking Lee Harvey Oswald, Jake manages to prevent him from shooting Kennedy”

He returns hoping to see a much improved world, instead he sees one in ruins and a nuclear war that has destroyed much of the world.

FS blog highlights this as a classic example of how everything is connected and of Butterfly Effect.

The butterfly effect is the idea that small things can have non-linear impacts on a complex system.

In 12th grade, at the Common Admission Test, I lost out the last general merit medical college seat in my city (that cost 200 USD/yr vs 1500 USD/yr that others were willing to pay) to a person who was 4 ranks ahead of mine.

That translated to probably 2-3 marks more than I scored in my Botany/Zoology exam.

3 marks that probably changed the course of what I did for the rest of my life – who I married, what I studied or where I worked.

For the longest time, my Quora profile read ‘Believer of the Butterfly Effect’.

We tend to misinterpret it as small events that can drive ‘leverage’ but ‘the reality is that small things in a complex system may have no effect or a massive one, and it is virtually impossible to know which will turn out to be the case’

The FS blog again summarizes this well.

“We like to think we can predict the future and exercise a degree of control over powerful systems such as the weather and the economy.

Yet the butterfly effect shows that we cannot.”

Be kind to yourself.

Owning the Customer Experience Value Chain – End to End Operators

Do you remember contacting people with Yellow Pages?

This evolved further where you could find a carpenter online but the process of contacting them remained largely offline.

Then came the marketplaces that allows the transactions to occur online.

[Battery Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) has this brilliant article where they talk about this phenomenon where more start-ups are ‘full stack’ in delivering customer experiences from the ground up.

Or as they call it, ‘End to End Operators’

By owning the complete value chain they create

**#Better** functional customer experience, cheaper and faster

**#Owning** operations stack allows better control over quality, service or pricing

**#Is** it for everyone? Maybe not. These end-to-end models require more capital to scale than narrowly focused startups though have a net positive ROI in the long run

The first example that struck me when I was reading this was Tesla.

Most of these have gone ahead to disrupt the incumbents in the sector.

Can you think of startup examples in the India market, owning and reinventing customer experience, end to end?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Sometimes it may feel like nothing is really the way it should be.

Or that there is no progress.

One of the books I read had a great rule to add perspective –

The 10–10–10 rule makes long-term thinking easy and practical. … Think not only about how you feel in the moment, but also ten minutes, ten months, and ten years from now. Then decide.

If isn’t something that you would be ashamed about 10 years from now – don’t let it kill you today. .

I thought this was a great reminder.

Growing up, I constantly struggled with anxiety of not doing enough. Of not being enough.

Maybe it was the pressure to prove myself to my parents. Or probably self-inflicted.

But there was this constant voice at the back of my head.

Not smart enough. Not pretty enough. Not social enough. Could have connected the dots better. Should have tried harder.

A lot of ‘what if’s’, could have’s , should have’s and mentors later, I realize the futility of it all.

Much later, I came across the Atlas complex when I was doing an [IDEO](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) course.

The Atlas complex : Any time I worked on leading change, I have \[I realize now\] unintentionally, carried the weight of the change on my shoulder.

It is hugely liberating to understand that we can harness the collective energy to take action and not have to suffer from the Atlas complex.

So yeah, if you are questioning yourself – you are enough. As you are.

‘Cryptocurrencies have 4 times more investors than mutual funds’ in India

A CREBACO study claims that the total number of cryptocurrency investors in India is 10.5 crore with investments of over $10 billion

That is as opposed to 2.6 crore unique mutual fund investors.

The government, has indicated that it plans to regulate cryptocurrencies to prevent investors from holding them without any restriction.

I believe technology isn’t inherently good or bad.

It depends on the intention of the user.

Big believer of technology and absolutely bet on futuristic tech for common good, but here is a reminder as old as time – be aware of your why behind your investments.

And that better not be greed.

“All greed starts with an innocent idea: that you are right, deserve to be right, or are owed something for your efforts. It’s a reasonable feeling”

Did you know the fascinating story behind why we don’t pay for a web browser?

Or how Mozilla got its name

At that point in time, accessing the internet was a closed academic thing.

“The key technical people didn’t want the internet to become easy to use or graphical because that would pollute the environment”

It was meant to be ‘only smart people could use the internet so we needed to keep it hard to use’

So Marc Andreessen is back then this young kid putting himself through college at University of Illinois while working at the attached National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)

He fundamentally disagrees with that. His playbook to success is simple – ‘let’s take something very esoteric, make it very available to everyone’

He comes up with the original Mosiac Browser – the gateway that opens up the world wide web to the millions of users across the world

He eventually graduates and Mosaic becomes a NCSA thing – not a Marc’s thing.

Eventually he meets Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics. They brainstorm ideas and decide to recreate Mosaic and commercialize it. They eventually come up with the company that is the first IPO blockbuster – Netscape – first real internet tech startup

So their browser Mozilla internally stands for Mosaic killer

In April ‘94, Netscape had an 80% market share of web browsers in the world and had successfully killed Mosaic by then.

They go public at $20/share. It opens at $75/share and gives the company a 3 Bn market cap

It is a beautiful time-tested business model

Give away the consumer thing for free, get as many people on that as you possibly can. It’s actually the first real example of aggregation theory.

Netscape ends up becoming powerful in the ecosystem because they are able to get all the internet users using it.

And yes, it is the same Marc Andreesen of Andreesen Horowitz. Its a story that inspires.

Acquired has a brilliant podcast with the story –

A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) was called out as the ‘most interesting idea in ML in the last 10 years’

Think of them as a model that can generate new content.

It has 2 networks – a generator and a discriminator.

The generator creates fake samples and tries to fool the discriminator into believing that they are real.

The discriminator will try to detect the generated samples from both the real and fake samples.

A lot of attention garnered is due to its interesting applications – say, generating synthetic data, image to image translation and yes, anime.

Though concerns abound around security and potential for malicious intent, Generative AI is part of Gartner’s Top Technology Trends 2022

“By 2025, generative AI will account for 10% of all data produced, from less than 1% today”

While we wait for more synthetic data, here is an anime of mine created on AnimeGANv2

I was recently re-watching the series, House.

There is this episode featuring a doctor who gave up on her cancer research when she was quite close to figuring a cure.

She decides to drop it all one fine day – to become a sous chef and attend book clubs.

There is a lot of discussion on whether to be ‘happy’ or ‘fulfilled’ in life. And can one really be both?

“Won’t you feel terrible about all the lives you could have saved, but chose not to, when on your death bed?”, she is judged.

“I might be”, she says, “on the day of my death, but at least I’d be happy on the remaining 25,000 days that I am alive”

To know that is one thing. To have the gumption to do that, quite another 🙂

Do you hustle or do you live your present?

There have been umpteen posts about the hustle culture and also on the flip side, about people deeply rethinking their priorities after a life affirming emergencies.

AI isn’t 42\. It isn’t the answer to everything.

‘Can we use AI to…..’? is something one hears oft.

We’ll use AI to solve it, say startups, to gnarly problems

A human centric approach to designing AI starts, rightly so, with the user problem in focus’

‘How can we solve for x?’

‘Can AI solve for this problem in a unique way?’

Maybe we need AI, maybe we don’t. We don’t need to build a churn model – we need to figure out how to reduce churn.

Maybe AI is used to automate or augment intelligence. But that AI is a tool. Not the solution.

Designing Human-Centered AI Products starts with the user. Not the tool.

The unheard story of how we almost blew the vaccine

Have you wondered how the COVID vaccine got to the hands of the general population so incredibly quickly?

Here is the brilliant story of an immigrant who refused to give up – thankfully so.

Their breakthrough saved the world from the worst of the pandemic—and opened a new world of medicines and vaccines for a huge range of diseases.

Here is her tale

**#1** Hungarian biochemist Katalin Karikó had been trying to make mRNA vaccines work for 30 years while fighting scientific gatekeepers who thought her idea was absurd.

**#2** Her grants were denied, her papers rejected, her speaking invitations withdrawn; eventually demoted. But she still refused to quit, and in 2005, she and collaborator Drew Weissman figured out how mRNA could direct our own cells to manufacture medicines to order

**#3** A daughter of a butcher, Katalin Kariko grew up in Communist Hungary, in a home without TV, refrigerator, or running water. She became fascinated by mRNA in grad school—but when her lab ran out of funding in 1985, she decided to come to the States with her husband and 2-year-old daughter. 

**#4** She was refused funds and grants FOR YEARS. “Yeah, I did not get money. They always ask me that—you know, who is my supervisor? The woman, an accent, probably she wouldn’t come up with ideas like that”

**#5** But at least two people cared a lot about the breakthrough. One of them was Ugur Sahin, cofounder of the German drug company BionTech, which would go on to develop the Biontech/Pfizer COVID vaccine. He hired Kariko in 2013; she works at Biontech to this day. 

**#6** She made almost nothing out of the deals licensing out her technology. But neither she nor Drew seem to hold any grudges.

“I am 66 old. My family, my husband, we never have a new car. Probably I’d never buy a new car, because we’re so used to it not to have a new one! “

“To us, solving the problem, developing the new findings, new technology, new treatments —to us that’s —what’s important. Grievances, who cares? “

**#7** “The vaccine industry is going to pretty much all move over to RNA vaccines, simply because they— they’re very effective. They can be made very, very quickly. And ultimately, I think the cost of goods will be much cheaper. 

It’s also being used —for, you know, oncology. So, cancer applications. I mean, I think the possibilities are limitless”

One of the best things I heard this weekend. Check out the comments for the podcast link

“Jan is managing a new team, and she notices that one of her team members, Carl, is using a new piece of software incorrectly. She offers him some advice and returns to her work. But later, she notices that he’s still misusing it. So, she decides to sit with him until he gets it right.

Over the next few days, Jan notices that Carl has become standoffish with her. He’s defensive when she offers him feedback, and he avoids talking to her. Jan is bewildered – all she wants to do is to help Carl, and she can’t figure out why he’s reacting so badly to her support.

If she’d used the SCARF Model, Jan would have realized that Carl wasn’t being difficult – he just felt threatened. The way she handled the situation made Carl feel silly and stupid, instead of empowered”

SCARF Model – using neuroscience to work effectively with others

I am a huge fan of mental models. Used right, they are immensely helpful in decision making, opportunity sizing, problem framing to working as a team.

If you lead or work with a team, something you might have noticed is how people are motivated by different things.

SCARF stands for the five key “domains” that influence our behavior in social situations. These are:

**#1** Status – our relative importance to others.

**#2** Certainty – our ability to predict the future.

**#3** Autonomy – our sense of control over events.

**#4** Relatedness – how safe we feel with others.

**#5** Fairness – how fair we perceive the exchanges between people to be.

Understanding and using the SCARF model at the workplace not just helps you to understand your teams better (for example, give the status person a chance to evaluate themselves better before mishandling feedback) but yourself as a leader better too (do you tend to down play ideas of highly skilled folks because that makes you feel threatened?)

What has helped you work better as a team?

The rise of the FANG companies is no accident. They are all connected on one common thread – The Aggregation theory.

So how does this winning playbook work?…..

This is from one of my favorite strategy blogs – Stratechery. Here is a summary in 5 points –

1. The value chain for any given consumer market is divided into three parts: suppliers, distributors, and consumers/users
2. How do you gain outsized profits in such markets? – Have a horizontal monopoly in 1 out of 3\. OR integrate two of the parts so that you have a competitive advantage in delivering a vertical solution.
3. The internet has done two things possible  
   1. Made distribution of digital goods free ( this neutralized the advantage that pre-internet distributers leveraged with suppliers, e.g: content creators)  
   2. Transaction costs zero (allow forward integration with customers at scale.
4. This means that the dynamics is completely different now. Distributors don’t compete based on exclusive supplier relationships with customers as an after thought. Instead, suppliers can be commoditized leaving consumers/users as a first order priority. By extension, this means that the most important factor determining success is the user experience” The aggregators that provide the best user experience, win
5. Lets talk examples.  
   1. Previously, publishers integrated content and advertisements. Facebook modularized advertisements by allowing advertisers to target customers directly, not via proxy  
   2. Previously, book publishers integrated editing, marketing and distribution. Amazon modularized distribution first via e-commerce and then via e-books  
   3. Previously, networks integrated broadcast availability and content purchases. Netflix modularized broadcast availability by making its entire library available at any time in any order  
   4. Previously, publishers integrated publications and articles. Google modularized individual pages and articles, making them directly accessible via search  
   5. Previously, taxi companies integrated dispatch and fleet management. Uber modularized fleet management by working with independent drivers.

As he says, every industry will discover that it has a critical function that can be digitized and commodified, precipitating this shift.

The bottom line, “Companies that win the user experience can generate a virtuous cycle where their ownership of consumers/users attracts suppliers which improves the user experience”

Such a brilliant way to understand powerful businesses in the Internet age and what sets them apart

Thoughts?

My earliest memories of Diwali was being woken up at 4.30 AM by Amma.

My brother and I, unlike our usual grumpy morning selves, jumped out of bed eager for the day to begin.

We were asked not to open our eyes as she led our blindfolded selves to a pedestal where she had a bowl of coins and an idol of Laxmi, the Goddess of Prosperity, we blinked our eyes open to.

Appa then applied the 3 drops of sesame oil on onto each of our heads for the ritualistic oil bath.

Given that the person who gets done first would light the first cracker, it was a game of deceit, manipulation and speed.

Amma usually had a mix of herb and soap-nut powder to wash off the oil. To offset the time I’d take washing off my longer hair, I usually hid the brother’s new clothes.

Oft surprises me about how I never have looked forward to anything new as much as I did for the new clothes that Appa usually set out for me.

In the backyard, under the jackfruit tree, was our target – the huge black bag with crackers of every kind.

It was Appa’s job to resolve the fights that always broke out – for the brother insisted on giving me all the ‘girly ones’ – from the ‘sparklers, twinklers to the ground spinners’ while filling up his bag with the ‘atom bombs’, ‘rockets’ to the ‘100-wala’ crackers.

At the crack of dawn, the tree-lined street burst out in the din of crackers – resplendent in lights and colors of every kind.

As the first light flooded the horizon, Amma called us (and then pulled our reluctant selves) back home – to the piping hot idli she had set out for breakfast.

Our fights forgotten, in the united liaison against the neighbors, we returned – looking forth to the rest of the brilliant day with the yummy sweets that never ended.

While I try hard at times to recreate the gestalt of this childhood narrative for the kid to remember as a fond memory, I realize it cannot be the same.

In a world bombarded with a dozen things seeking our attention, instant gratification and hedonic adaption, the little I hope to try is to help her build a healthy relationship with wealth.

To use money to buy time and not the other way around.

And to go Slow to go Fast.

Do you have a favorite Diwali memory?

Happy Diwali! 🙂

What is the origin of the term Metaverse?

Have you read of Snowcrash?

It’s one of Naval’s recommended readings. A 1992 science fiction novel by Neal Stephenson’s 1992 first coined the term – Metaverse

It was used to describe a place where humans, as avatars, interact with each other and software agents, in a three-dimensional virtual space that uses the metaphor of the real world.

Stephenson used the term to describe a virtual reality-based successor to the Internet.

The concept of the metaverse has quickly become a buzzword in technology and business. Something that has accelerated in the post COVID world.

Where will you display the most expensive non-fungible token (NFT) artwork ever bought?

The $69 M NFT-backed digital artwork bought by Metakovan is planned to be displayed in a virtual monument called ‘The Souk’ that they’re building in a virtual, online world.

Interesting times we live in. Thoughts?

Play it safe or take a Career Risk?

Growing up in an incentivized-for-performance environment that most Asian parents tend to fall into, I dreaded failure.

It meant I followed a straitjacketed path and avoided risks.

Like picking STEM or management courses I felt had better ROI over Culture and Communication or Semiotics.

Or picking an internship at the prestigious ISRO, only to focus on topping the class vs learning from the experience.

It is thus refreshing to see the new cohort of kids exploring unchartered territory even before they are out of college.

And risks doesn’t really always imply switching to entrepreneurship.

It could mean getting out of your career bubble and moving out of your silos at work.

Talking to people at work you usually may not interact with.

Being ok with doing something that isn’t your area of expertise.

Offering to help someone without really seeking something in return – great way to get mentors

Or, even, like in my case, prioritizing my family, and not dying with the guilt of taking a downtime.

Sometimes moving sideways may be the fastest way to move up

What is a career risk you have taken?

After Facebook (17 years), Tesla became the second fastest company to hit the $1 trillion valuation mark.

Tesla is now worth as much as 19 other automakers, including Toyota, GM, Honda, and Nissan, combined.

What is interesting is that Tesla’s value is 15x higher than Ford’s, even though Ford brought in $115+ billion more in revenue last year.

It probably highlights a lot of things – one could say that the valuation is exaggerated, but it also “shows that investors believe the future of the auto industry lies in electric vehicles”.

And Tesla has a huge part to play in that future.

What do you think of the EV market?

##### #3 Distributed Enterprise – Top Technology Trends 2022

1) **WHY** – Gartner pegs two reasons for the rise of this trend

a) COVID driven remote-first working had organizations require different tools and increased flexibility

b) Consumers increasingly aren’t available via traditional, physical avenues

2) **WHAT** – Distributed enterprise is a virtual-fist, remote-first architectural approach to digitize consumer touch-points and build out experiences to support products.

3) **WHERE** is it used today? ‘Armoire’s digital dressing room allows customers to try styles virtually.

Traditional office-centric organizations are evolving into distributed enterprises comprised of geographically dispersed workers.

“Research shows that up to 74% of data is not analyzed in most organizations and up to 82% of enterprises are inhibited by data silos”

Top Technology Trends 2022 – #2 Data Fabric

1) WHAT : A data fabric architecture provides a connective tissue between data endpoints— enabling the full breadth of data management capabilities including integration, discovery, governance, curation, and orchestration

2) WHY : Top performing enterprises are data driven. However, several challenges block them from fully exploiting all data. Lack of data access. Numerous data sources and data types. Data integration complexities.

3) VALUE : A data fabric’s real value is its ability to dynamically improve data usage with its inbuilt analytics, cutting data management efforts by up to 70% and accelerating time to value.

4) BUSINESS OUTCOME : With a data fabric, your business users and data scientists can access trusted data faster for their applications, analytics, AI and machine learning models, and business process automation, helping to improve decision making and drive digital transformation

It can

* Enable self-service data consumption and collaboration
* Automate governance, data protection and security enabled by active metadata
* Automate data engineering tasks and augment data integration

5) “By 2024 data fabric deployments will quadruple efficiency in data utilization while cutting human-driven data management tasks in half” – Gartner

Disparate data and trusted data availability for agile analysis is such a core issue and a relatable problem.

This seems quite a utopian solution, if it could work. How do you see this helping out enterprises?

Top Technology Trends 2022 – **#1** Generative AI

“By 2025, generative AI will account for 10% of all data produced, from less than 1% today”

1) WHAT : Generative AI refers to “programs that can use existing content like text, audio files, or images to create new plausible content”. In layman terms, it enables computers to learn the underlying pattern related to the input, and then use that to generate similar (artificial) content/data.

2) APPLICATIONS? Applications include the much touted/controversial ‘Deepfakes”. It produces real looking photos, image-to-image conversions (B/W to color, photo to paintings…), Film restoration, Ageing… “Generative AI can be used for a range of activities such as creating software code, facilitating drug development and targeted marketing”

3) HOW: There are various techniques to do that such as generative adversarial networks (GANS), transformers, and variational autoencoders

4) CONCERNS: It could be “misused for scams, fraud, political disinformation, forged identities and more”

5) HOW IS IT USED TODAY? Gartner calls out the use-case where ” the UK financial conduct authority has used generative AI to create synthetic payment data by abstracting information from 5 M records of real payment data. This synthetic data set will be used to create new fraud models without revealing individual data

What are 4 Big Ideas that Fintech Will Tackle in 2021

The a16z fintech team weighs in – Read more about the top trends and what is driving them

**#1** Disintermediating the banking system

\> Banks usually serve as intermediaries between the consumer and the government.

\> Fintech, the article states, allows governments to remove intermediate bureaucracy and make monetary services available directly to the citizens

\> With >5B of folks today having mobile internet connectivity, “every consumer eventually will access their savings, loans, and investments via a mobile app”

**#2** Adding insurance to the financial services

\> Every company will be a fintech company” – Consumer and B2B companies have seen the opportunity to add fintech (payments, lending..) to drive revenue. Now, can companies add services such as insurance to that?

\> Historically asset and insurance purchase have been de-coupled (car, insurance)

\> Can we embed insurance at the point of purchase?

**#3** Emergence of ‘Social+’ fintech products

\> Start-up success is attributed to two things – product and distribution insight ( what the core USP offers and how well it is distributed)

\> New fintech products focus on leveraging ‘network effects’ – more utility when used with others – thereby driving incentive to drive distribution

\> “Multiplayer products have built-in growth levers, they make activity around money — investing, financial planning, even saving — more engaging and fun!”

**#4** Emerging new asset classes

\> Imagine a small investor owning a classic painting? Is that even an investment you have considered? What if it is made available through a ‘fractionalized ownership’ model?

What other trends have you noticed in the Fintech space post COVID?

Here is the A16z detailed report on the topic : https://a16z.com/2020/12/17/big-ideas-for-fintech-2021/

#SystemsThinkingDay2 – Why do people often sacrifice resilience for productivity or some other immediately recognizable system property?

Injections of genetically engineered bovine growth hormone increase the milk production of a cow without proportionally increasing the cow’s intake.

The hormone diverts some of the cow’s metabolic energy from other bodily functions to milk production.

The cost of increased production is lowered resilience – the cow is less healthy, less long-lived and more dependent on human management

Resilience is not being static or constant over time

Static stability is something you can see and measured by variation in the condition of a system – week by week or year by year

Resilience is something that is hard to see unless you exceed the systems’ limits

You see this repeated across systems – in the way we prioritize for short term timber over the ecological impact to the short term focus on productivity vs hiring the right person for the role.

“Systems need to be managed not only for productivity or stability, they also need to be managed for resilience— the ability to recover from perturbation, the ability to restore or repair themselves.”

**#SystemsThinkingDay1** – Deconstructing Complex Systems – Hierarchy

There were two watchmakers – Hora and Tempus. They both made fine watches and soon people were visiting their stores more often, and the orders for new watches were increasing in both stores.

However, Horas’ business prospered over the years, but Tempus became poorer and poorer, eventually went bankrupt.

Why was one craftsman successful but the other not?

When they both had fewer orders, they could spend hours improving the design and it didn’t matter. As the demand for watches increased, so the phone calls and people in their shops.

At that time, Tempus was making watches in the way —all parts needed to be assembled together at once. If he had to serve the customer in the middle of his work, he put the unfinished watch down – and it often fell to pieces. When he returned to work, he usually needed to start from the beginning.

But the way Hora assembled a watch was different. Hora was building watches by stable blocks – one block at a time. As a result, when Hora had to put down a partly completed watch – to see the customer – he lost only a tiny part of his work. He made his watches much faster and more efficiently than did Tempus.

Complex systems can evolve from simple systems only if they have stable intermediate forms – a characteristic called **#1Hierarchy**

This is from one of the most useful books I have ever read – Thinking in Systems: A Primer, by Donella H. Meadows, Diana Wright

As I read this, as one review put it, I swayed between bring hugely inspired to being underwhelmed with the feeling that my life was quite mediocre in comparison.

What I did love is how it stuck to the no-bull shit rule that some self-help books tend to move quickly into

Here are three counter-intuitive lessons from the book that I want to leave you with

1. Aim to be Zero
2. Sweat the Small Stuff
3. Don’t visualize success

Are you Above Average? How Do We Succeed in a World That Values Sameness

Every day we are measured against the yardstick of averages, judged according to how closely we come to it or how far we deviate from it.

The assumption that metrics comparing us to an average—like GPAs, personality test results, and performance review ratings— is so ingrained in our consciousness that we don’t even question it.

That assumption, says Harvard’s Todd Rose, in his book End of Average, is spectacularly—and scientifically—wrong

The average-size-fits-all model ignores our differences and fails at recognizing talent.

In the early 1940s, gynecologists made an alabaster model of a typical young female by averaging the proportions of thousands of women.

The statue, named Norma, was hailed as a physical ideal.

Yet when a newspaper ran a contest fewer than 40 applicants even came close.

Instead, he recommends the three principles of individuality in his book that I highly recommend

“Our modern conception of the average person is not a mathematical truth but a human invention, created a century and a half ago by two European scientists to solve the social problems of their era.”

Have you ever felt limited by your need to fit within the curve and excel against the average?

What NOT to say in an email?

[LinkedIn News](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) recently had an post about passive aggressive phrases to avoid in emails. Do you use any of these?

– Per last email

– For Future reference

– Bumping this to the top of your inbox…

– Just to be sure we are on the same page…

– Going forward…..

Here are a couple of additional tips for you to manage your emails (rather than the other way around)

**#1** ‘Be nice, be respectful’ – If it isn’t something you wouldn’t say to them physically, don’t write it in an email – assume all emails get read.

**#2** ‘Assume positive intent’: Do not misinterpret an innocuous status question into ‘am I not collaborating’. Start with assumed goodwill. This applies to life too.

**#3** Write fewer emails : The elephant in the room – the quantum of emails! In his book, Indistractable, [Nir Eyal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) calls out that on an average people get 100 mails/day. That could translate to more than half a productive work-day feeding our elephant brain of seemingly ‘doing work’.

So as he recommends, timebox your time with emails.

If possible have notifications off – I block my first half for critical work + reading and second for emails + meetings.

I also have a ‘Amma is busy at work’ post-it on my door, which oft gets overlooked. But well, one can only but try 🙂

Any other tips for effective communication at work?

In one study, designers were tasked with creating a banner ad with one of 2 processes.

Half were instructed to design “one ad at a time” – receiving feedback after each new design each time – 5 feedback yielding a total of 6 ads.

The other half of designers were asked to use “a simultaneous process” – each one started with 3 ads and received feedback on all finally whittling it down to 1 ad.

All of the designers finally created the same number of ads \[6\] and received the same number of feedback \[5\].

The only difference was the process – simultaneous vs one at a time.

As it turned out, process mattered a great deal – the simultaneous designers’ ads were judged superior and earned higher click through rates

Why?

\[1\] Since simultaneous participants received feedback on multiple items, they were more likely to analyze critique side by side. In other words, they were multi-tracking and learning something useful.

\[2\] Multi-tracking has another unexpected advantage – it feels better. Asked to rate feedback – 80% of multi track designers found it helpful vs 35%.

Key take-away – People who work on a single track begin to take their work too personally and view criticism of their only option.

So one way of not taking your work too seriously (and be better at it) is to not make work the only thing you do in life 🙂

Elon Musk, Memes and Tesla

In one of his Clubhouse appearances, Elon Musk was asked about his love of memes:

“It is safe to say that you might be the master of the memes, and in fact you had a quote that “Who controls the memes controls the universe.” Can you just explain what you meant by that?”

Elon : It’s a play on words from Dune, “Who controls the spice controls the universe”, and if memes are spice then it’s memes.

… How do things become interesting to people?

… I don’t know, I love memes, I think they can be very insightful, and you know throughout history, symbolism in general has powerfully affected people”

In his brilliant blog, [Stratechery](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Ben Thomson makes the analogy of the meme with Tesla as a symbol.

“The real payoff of Musk’s “Master Plan” is the fact that Tesla means something: yes, it stands for sustainability and caring for the environment, but more important is that Tesla also means amazing performance and Silicon Valley cool”

Makes for a great weekend read – check out the article here

Crying babies, Women and Work.

I heard such a relatable podcast this morning – sounds ridiculous yet true.

NPR’s PLANET MONEY had this show where first up, a woman tries to buy from female-led companies not just for one breakfast picnic, but for a whole week and struggles through it.

Women-led startups received just 2.3% of venture capital funding in 2020

They spoke about why it is so hard for women to create and retain control of their own companies?

And why maybe, just maybe, this moment we’re in provides a unique opportunity to think about a major economic force standing in the way of millions of women – crying babies.

If you have ever had crying babies, they are a force unto themselves.

The tragedy over the past year and a half is that we have seen millions of women get pushed out of the workforce to go care for those kids because it’s often not possible to do both at the same time – work and child care.

So take a moment to breathe if you are going through this. And if you happen to be at the other side of the table, please be aware and acknowledge it.

In a majority of cases being an expert at Python or SQL alone doesn’t help.

Driving value with data isn’t about tools or code alone.

And this is an area I oft find as a huge gap.

– Can you convert an output to an outcome?

– Are you looking at the relevance of the attributes you choose for the model in the user journey?

– Do you understand what the end stakeholders want and can translate it into a technical solution

– Can you work with ambiguity and use data to help drive roadmap vs waiting for the PM to tell you want is to be done?

– Can you be the data steward who can help identify gaps and opportunities to drive product strategy?

– Can you work with cross functional teams to influence decisions

– Can you prioritize your actions based on ROI of your decisions

You may not necessarily start with all these skills but working towards them is critical.

A sure-shot path to failure is to ignore them – especially as you grow in your career.

As Seth Godin puts it, if all you is code as well as another, there is always someone cheaper to replace you. Or tech that would make you redundant

Are you building a unique skill stack?

The Future of Self Driving Cars you should know about

– The ‘Uber model’ vs the ‘Self driving pods’ business model

**#Model1** Ride-sharing companies such as Uber, Lyft (partnering with Waymo) have been working on AI based autonomous tech

These driver-less vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5 (a car that requires a human driver is considered Level 2 or 3 – semi-autonomous)

The future may be based on renting out these taxis without ever having to own a car (something that Peter Diamandis also calls out in the book, ‘The future is Faster than you Think’).

This is though a hard AI problem to solve – including the ethical and legal implications. India, for example, has banned self-driving cars to protect driver jobs.

**#Model2**– The ‘self-driving PODs are slow, boring and weird looking – and that’s probably a good thing’.

As compared to the first model, small low stakes self-driving pilots are already being used.

Many startups are betting on self-driving cars in low-risk applications – limited to 25 mph. Such as grocery delivery.

The start-up Nuro has launched delivery pods that are perfectly fine for delivering groceries. This will be not just an acceptable use-case to shuttling humans but also allow them to test-iterate and compete eventually against the Waymo’s of the world.

French startup Navya has been operating a similar-looking autonomous shuttle in Las Vegas for almost a year. The shuttle crosses eight intersections on its circular route, has transported thousands of passengers

Amazon interestingly, is playing out both the models partnering with Lyft while exploring driver-less grocery delivery with pods. Zoox, the autonomous vehicle company, was acquired by Amazon for roughly $1.2 billion last June.

Either ways, its an exciting future.

As Sergey Brin puts it, ‘We don’t claim that the cars are going to be perfect. Our goal is to beat human drivers’

What do you think is the future of autonomous cars?

\[On a lighter note, I was thinking of this and then the image of the traffic choked Silk-Board in Bangalore popped before me. Maybe not in Bangalore in my lifetime :)\]

I was talking to a start-up founder and was pleasantly surprised at how data informed their decisions were.

There seems to be largely two kinds of startup founders –

One who trusts data driven/data informed product building.

And then those who use data and analytics as an after thought.

As a founder, you get to choose where you focus on – and when used right, data informed product building can be truly a competitive advantage

And this isn’t about using shiny new toys or algorithms but to get fundamentals right –

**#1** Well defined North-star metrics and success framework – Aligned to your company’s core mission. Example, is that ‘daily or weekly active usage’ if you are growth focused? Avoid too many metrics and/or vanity metrics.

**#2** Engagement <> Stickiness : Are your customers returning because of notification or through their own volition? Do you have metrics tracking that. What is a meaningful product interaction?

**#3** Retention – How does your quick ratio look like? Do you look at retained and win-back cohorts over time? If you have net positive growth but very few of them are retained, then product doesn’t seem to have a core value prop and is acquiring users through growth hacking probably…

**#4** How do you measure health – Across growth, user adoption, market metrics and retention

**#5** Segmentation – Are you monitoring growth across multiple dimensions that are relevant to your business?

What has been your focus as a start-up founder in making data assets your competitive advantage?

How do company’s build the escape velocity to move beyond the successes and pull from the past? Geoffrey Moore’s Stanford video is hands-down the best use of an hour of my weekend.

We have examples of companies that failed to do so in time. Think Blackberry – from a 20% market share in 2009 to less than 0.05% in 2016\. Why does it happen and how can organizations avoid it?

Moore argues that when companies focus too much on performance, they miss out on building the power to become the industry leaders that other companies envy.

He provides a great analogy – right now if you pollute the air, it’s free. And as long as it’s free people will continue with the behavior.

But unless we think about replenishing the failing system – that’s exactly what will happen.

He talks about how consuming power in organizations is similar -from successes that are currently working.

Additionally one gets compensated for consuming power for my performance. Not for creating power around a new strategy.

“Now, the interesting thing is, in a mature industry you can do that for a long, long time. General Motors consumed its own power for 40 years. Eventually, it ran out of power.

And the performance metrics don’t track against that. So we need to replenish power if we’re going to go for the long-term

When you consume power and don’t replenish it, you’ll see it going to one and even below one as you get into trouble. And so what happens in a world in which we don’t consciously manage power, is we continue to put anxiety and pressure to perform, perform, perform, but every quarter it’s a little harder to do than the last quarter”

The talk has two parts – the first focused on what boards of organizations should look at differently. And the second, what folks like your or I can do differently within our organizations.

Also, I thought this was equally applicable to individuals – not just organizations.

Do give it a listen! Highly recommend

Becoming better – One thing I learnt in the last 3 months.

I made a couple of personal changes – started a Decision Log and focused on Deliberate Practice.

And this is what I have learnt

That I am not as good as I thought I was. Across areas – from Strategy, Leadership, Communication to Analytics.

Here are some ideas to get started

**#1** Start with keeping a log of decisions you take, why and how they have turned out. Identify your actions that caused a poor and good decision.

**#2** Seek feedback from people you work with around things that you should start-stop and continue. For example – I realize I most often skip the small talk and get to task solving unless I am conscious about it.

**#3** Identify problem use-cases around areas you want to improve on and talk out aloud/write down scenarios of how you would tackle it. Example – How should you handle working with ambiguity with specific examples.

**#4** Record yourself introducing yourself or explaining something to another person and listen to it. I have realized I tend to not just talk fast but also communicate too many things within a single conversation. Something that doesn’t make for impact.

**#5** Talk to people – Learning from people is something I have oft ignored in lieu of books. This is absolutely game changing.

So yes, while it is highly uncomfortable, challenging and questions my sense of self worth at times, I would rather identify and work on it than to stay in a blind-spot.

Do you have ideas or tips around how you have actively worked on improving yourself?

Here is an [FS blog](https://fs.blog/2021/04/deliberate-practice-guide/) on the topic

Are Machines and NFT’s the Future of art and music?

Mitosis is a two-minute video loop made up of over 750,000 faces continually being generated by a GAN.

It is under bidding at Sotheby’s for \~76K USD as a curated NFT.

The owner Mario Klignemann has used an endlessly moving and changing artwork – images created not by the human artist but by the machine.

The other image shows how an artificial neural network “sees” the Vincent Van Gogh’s most renowned paintings “Starry Night.” 

As an Nautilus article sums up beautifully,

“AI art like Klingemann’s shows that machines can imagine what we cannot imagine and see what we cannot see. 

The point is not whether we can distinguish AI-created music from human music but whether machines will be able to create music of their own, music we cannot imagine”

“I am working hard to stay abreast of advances in tech. Yet it seems like I am stuck at the same place while I see start-up founders half my age crushing it”. ‘Will I ever get ahead of the curve?’

This was from a mid-management professional.

There is a term for this – The Red Queen Effect.

The Red Queen Effect is based on the character in Alice in Wonderland

The queen schools Alice when she finds herself running faster and faster but staying in the same place.

“It refers to the increased pressure to adapt faster just to survive, is driven by an increase in the evolutionary pace of rival technology solutions”

What does this mean for us?

Rather than run harder, it is recommended to run smarter.

Here are three of the ways we can try to avoid the Red Queen as per a FS blog.

**#1** Invest in learning and adding real-world value to people. This is not a popular path as it’s incredibly expensive in time and money. Standing still, however, is more expensive.

**#2** Spend our limited mental resources working on things that won’t change next week. Ex – Working with first principles, negotiation et all

**#3** Acknowledge ‘how the world works and not how we want it to work’.

What you’ll wish you’d known as a high school student.

Do you have people you have never met who teach you a lot?

For me, Paul Graham is one of them. Highly unlikely I would ever meet him.

Of all the exceptional things he blogs about, one thing I highly recommend is his ‘almost given speech to high school students’ –

“What you’ll wish you’d known”

He talks about how when adults asks kids the question, ‘what do you want to be when we grow up’, it is usually a conversation starter to get you talking.

Predictably, I always said the things I knew would make my parents proud. That I want to top every class and become an engineer or a doctor.

\*Upwind\*

He says that instead of us deciding what we want to be in 20 years time and what we should do now to get there, one doesn’t commit to anything in the future, “but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward”

“It’s not so important what you work on, so long as you’re not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you’ll take.

The best protection is always to be working on hard problems.

Hard means worry: if you’re not worrying that something you’re making will come out badly, or that you won’t be able to understand something you’re studying, then it isn’t hard enough”

It is something I think about as we raise our (very opinionated) 6 year old.

It is also something I think about every time there is this constant sinking feeling in my stomach when working on hard things.

Do check out his article and his blog. Maybe it helps your kid. Maybe it does you.

Paul Graham’s blog – http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html

Selling digital shirts, NFT’s and the emergence of virtual economy in metaverses

Ralph Lauren is now letting people buy digital clothing for their avatars within a virtual world in a new collaboration with Zepeto.

Zepeto is the South Korean social network and its 200 million users that interact in a virtual world. 

Ralph Lauren’s first line of digital products include 12 looks that cost between $.57 to $2.86 

Going a step further, they have also partnered to create a virtual version of the company’s flagship Madison Avenue store and a version of Central Park complete with accompanying coffee trucks.

“It’s also the largest metaverse in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a “hugely important market for us”, said their chief digital officer.

And a few months ago, I was wondering about how big of a market could exist for NFTs.

How do you see this accelerating? Is there a game for Indian players here?

Having worked in Pricing earlier, one thing that always catches my eye is how brands use price discrimination

It is essentially a way of ‘How can I identify people who are willing to pay more’.

A good example of this is the one highlighted by the behavioral economist in ‘The Undercover Economist’

“Every single product on the menu above costs Starbucks almost the same to product, down to a few odd pence.

By charging wildly different prices for products that largely have the same cost, Starbucks is able to smoke out customers who are less sensitive about the price”

I came across this membership model on [Farnam Street](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s website last evening. And it made me smile.

The transparency displayed highlighting why they charge different prices for the same content is quite authentic, if not unique

Have you noticed behavioral economics used in products you use?

“Remember hearing about the internet? Get ready for the metaverse”

Have you ever had this experience of buying a new car and then suddenly seeing the same model everywhere you go?

There is a reason why it happens. The part of the brain is apparently called the Reticular Activation System (RAS).

Think of it as the torchlight that focuses your attention and determines the lenses through which you see the world.

Maybe that is what I have been using for the half a dozen times I have stumbled upon ‘the Metaverse’ almost in everything I read.

So here is a lowdown on the Metaverse!

**#1** Coined by the writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel, “Snow Crash,” then reimagined as the Oasis in the Ernest Cline novel “Ready Player One,” it refers to a fully realized digital world that exists beyond the analog one in which we live.

(If you haven’t read either, please do)

**#2** The metaverse essentially is a virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality, augmented reality and the internet. If you own a NFT, crypto or have attended a work meeting with a digital avatar, you are treading quite close

**#3** The thing with connected networks is that they happen slowly and then all at once. There “will be no clean ‘Before Metaverse’ and ‘After Metaverse,’” writes a VC. “Instead, it will slowly emerge over time as different products, services and capabilities integrate and meld together.”

**#4** No one person or company can have control over the metaverse Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Sony have joined Facebook in the XR Association, a consortium of tech companies aiming to shape the future of “experiential reality.”

**#5** What do you do with a $69 million artwork that doesn’t physically exist? Singapore based investor, Metakovan, who purchased the NFT for $70 M plans to put the artwork on display in four virtual world environments. He is working with architects to design gallery complexes that the public can enter via web browsers or virtual reality technology.

The future is faster than we think.

And my constant thought as a mom is this – beyond our Indian schools getting kids to ace in Math and Science, to careers in Medicine and Engineering, are we really preparing our kids to the world they will face when they grow up 🙂

On Friday, Musk unveiled the manifestation of most sci-fi novels – Tesla Bot, a humanoid robot  
  
More than what the bot’s capabilities is to understand what this implies to us and the future of the world if this does succeed and scale  
  
“Our cars are like semi-sentient computers on wheels’ And that is the basis he says of what is in a humanoid form that prototypes next year.  
  
It is intended to be friendly and ‘eliminate dangerous, repetitive and boring tasks’  
  
Adding that “we’re setting it up, in a mechanical way, in a physical way, so that you can run away from it and most likely overpower it’  
  
For example ‘It should be able to please go to the store and get some groceries’  
  
[#What](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=what&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6834775248601251840) does it imply?  
  
“This would be quite profound because if we say what is the economy, then it is at the foundation, labor.  
So what happens when there is no shortage of labor? Because in the long term, there is going to be Universal Basic Income  
  
Essentially in the future physical work will be a choice. And it has profound implications for the economy because if the foundation of economy is labor then capital equipment is just distilled labor.  
  
Is there then any actual limit to the economy, maybe not”  
  
Love it or not, the future is going to look very different from the one you or I grew up in.  
  
If you were to be in a world where you don’t need to work for livelihood, what would it mean to you?

The job of a data scientist is to not just build models to predict which customers churn. Or dashboards to show KPIs around it.

The job of a data engineering team is not just to enable data from multiple sources.

Analytics and Engineering should actually help reduce churn.

Completing a task isn’t success. Driving impact is.

“A company’s ability to compete is measured by how successfully it applies analytics to vast, unstructured data sets across disparate sources to drive product innovation”

That takes huge transformation across people, processes and culture.

Have you been part of such a transformation? What has helped you drive value from analytics and data teams?

Did you catch the ‘Daring Greatly’ LinkedIn Live session [Prashant Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I did on Financial Literacy for Women last Sat?

If there is one thing to take-away, it is his R2T2 framework

**#1** R2T2 stands for Risk – Returns; Time- Trade-off. The concept is simple but fundamental to how we view wealth

**#2** Align your expectations of Returns with the Risk. You cannot expect returns of 15%+ with the security of Fixed Deposits. If anyone promises that – stay away from it

**#3** Your financial investments are dependent on your goals. If your risk appetite doesn’t allow for it, it shouldn’t bother you that your neighbor invests in crypto

**#4** If A is your current wealth value and B is your corpus destination you need in 20 years to maintain the same lifestyle, think of the investment vehicles that are various options to get there. He also shared a nifty back-of the envelop calculation to identify the corpus you need

**#5** Play the long term game. Time- trade-off. If you can stay put for 20 years, there is very little chance of you losing money from the markets

Check out the recording in the link below.

Fill in the google forms link for a follow-up financial literacy workshop for women that Prashant Desai and I are planning to have on the topic .

It is free and will always be.

I am hoping this helps with my goal of positively impacting at least 100 women this year!

A cousin in college wanted to understand a cap-table.

For some reason, she thought I was a VC. I am not. At least not yet!

Here is a 101 thread of how a cap-table (capitalization table) works

**#1What** – A cap-table (capitalization table) is the list of securities (stock, convertible notes, equity…) the company has issued and who owns what.

**#2When** – Typically used privately by private companies to provide information on a company’s investors and market value. It lists names and groups of investor(s), stockholders and founders against what they own and how much

**#3Who** uses it – Commonly used by start-ups and early stage businesses. It can be used though by all – its essentially then a breakdown of the company’s shareholder equity.

**#4Why** do startup’s need one? To answer who owns how much of the company. Its important because it impacts the fund-raising rounds and determines the decision makers.

**#5How** does it look like? In the simplistic version, it is a spreadsheet though there are software for it too. Below is an example of a cap-table template.

Did I miss anything?

A large majority of profiles that apply do not get shortlisted. Here are 5 tips on that could differentiate you

**#1**. If you do not know the hiring manager/person who can refer you – please don’t bombard strangers with ‘Hi’ messages on Linkedin. Do your homework upfront. Research about the company and roles they offer. Check out their careers page to identify open roles.

**#2**. I am yet to hear of one person who has actually got a role by typing ‘I am interested’ in comments. Invest your energy where it matters.

**#3**. Evaluate your why – why do you want a career in this space? What are your key skills – are you great at visualization, storytelling or building pipelines?

**#4**. Alignment to Role – Do your skillsets align with what is being offered? What are the gaps and are you working towards them? Again, do not aim for a 100% match.

**#5**. Do you have a portfolio of work that can showcase how you can add tangible value to the requisite role?

Now you can reach out to people within the organizations requesting for a referral. Share a summary of what role you are keen to apply, why and how you think you can add value upfront.

Being enterprising and focused alone differentiates you from the other 80% who aren’t.

Any other tips that has helped you?

It’s been around a year since I decided to share my thoughts out here. And yesterday I hit the 10,000 followers milestone.  
  
I want to thank each one of you who engage (and hopefully find value) with my content and to those who have provided feedback!  
  
10K isn’t probably a huge number and I am no expert.  
I never set out to build a personal brand but I believe the journey has helped me tremendously.  
  
Here is my 2 cents for anyone who’d like to get started.  
  
#1 Yes, I constantly struggle with ‘why will people listen to me’ when I post anything. Put yourself out there. Even when you fear it.  
  
#2 Writing each day is therapeutic, helps structure thoughts better and builds discipline. I know where I have improved.  
  
#3 Don’t sell your soul for likes. I have made peace with the fact that I will only post what authentically represents me – 7 likes or 300\. It doesn’t matter.  
  
#4 Meet people. Yes, I do get those random ‘frandship requests’, but largely, I have met a whole bunch of exceptional folks whom I have had the privilege to learn from.  
  
#5 Build Credibility, Community and Connections. There is always something new to learn each day.

Mark Cuban recently hailed the DeFi economy as the ‘next great growth engine’

To keep up with emerging technology, he is always reading and learning new things. From AI to cryptocurrency and the technology that surrounds it – blockchain and NFTs

Here is a 101 beginner’s thread to DeFi

**#1What** : Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a system of applications that aim to recreate traditional financial instruments with cryptocurrency

**#2DefiApplications** : Think of them as smartphone apps but they come built in with smart contracts. They run on Ethereum blockchain (Ether as the native currency)

**#3WhataretheUsecases** : Borrowing and Lending.

″\[T\]o borrow money, I have to be overcollateralized with my bank. I’ve got to call somebody. I’ve got to do a DocuSign, or sign something, \[and\] it’s got to get approved at multiple levels – …. it’s a hassle.

The \[bank\] fees are ridiculous as a percentage,” Cuban said. But, in ”\[o\]wning a crypto asset, whether it’s bitcoin or Ethereum, I can do my own banking and it’s very friction-free, very straightforward and fast. That lack of friction is the game-changer.”

**#4YieldFarming** : Is the other DeFi use case. It is the process of constantly lending and borrowing crypto to take advantage of the best interest rates – or “the search for passive income on crypto-assets,” 

**#5Risks** : “DeFi is highly experimental and exists in a regulatory grey zone,” as The Financial Times reported. “And as with elsewhere in the cryptocurrency sphere, there are risks of scams.”

And where does this stand closer home?

DeFi Alliance, an international trade association for decentralized finance, has announced its India chapter

The development also comes at a time when Indian developers in the blockchain and crypto space are attracting global attention after the success of Polygon and Instadapp.

Thoughts?

Driven by Gen Z and Millennials, Fintech start-ups are a fore-runner in startups funding

There are 5,010 FinTech startups in India

This is a sector I anticipate will further accelerate.

Here are extracts from a brilliant article extending this argument around why

**#1GenZ**‘ expectation around Finance has changed from their parents gen

…”This generation has embraced mobile banking and fintech in a way that previous generations did not.

And they grew up in the wake of the last financial crisis, so perhaps they don’t have the same unwavering trust in institutions as their parents did. They’re often more leery of debt and credit, as we see younger consumers preferring debit to credit cards. And they grew up with the internet. So all this seems to set the stage for the rise of fintech serving this particular market”

**#2What** is the advice for Fintech startup founders if they are building financial products for the increasingly savvy digital gen?

“a transparent business model. Being clear about how you’re making money and making sure that your incentives are aligned with your customer in the short and long term”

Thoughts on what other sectors would drive growth in the startup ecosystem?

Have you thought of brains as prediction machines?

Imagine you walk into your room one day and find that your laptop is looking smaller than usual.

Or that the stapler makes a different sound when being used

Would you notice?

Of course, we would.

We notice these changes even if we are not attending to these objects You don’t need to ask yourself if the stapler is the correct length. Changes to the normal just pop into your head. And your attention will be drawn to them by your brain. Almost instantly.

There is only one explanation, Jeff Dawkins’ says that is possible.

“My brain, specifically my neocortex, was making multiple simultaneous predictions of what you were about to see, hear or touch”

Every time I moved my eyes, it predicted the smallest gestures such as the texture of the coffee cup or the larger ones like the month you should expect to see on your computer.

You were not born knowing how a stapler sounds.

Prediction was the ubiquitous function of the neocortex. Predictions of the model of the world it expects. Constantly.

Neocortex constantly learns the model of the world and it makes predictions on what it expects across sensory modalities.

Does learning about the ultimate prediction machine help us design a better future with AI?

Why think about the Evolution of AI across Nations?  
  
State-driven strategic AI initiatives and ecosystem that accelerates the race to become the next AI super-power  
Ethics of AI, VC funds, evolving laws concerning AI usage and adherence/not across nations…  
  
Yes, all of that.  
  
But this topic intrigues me the most because I wonder about the world we leave behind for our kids.  
  
Whether I am equipping her (not with wealth, but) with being able to survive and thrive in a world very different from the one I grew up in.  
And hopefully choose to do the right thing.

Company first – Business Unit Next – Team Third – Individual Last

Always. Always think in that order.

If you are a working individual solving a problem, always put the company hat first when you think through the solution

If you are a hiring manager, please hire for folks with this outlook.

If you are start-up, establish this culture from the outset.

If you are a business leader, remember that your team will follow the precedent you set.

I recall reading the company-first narrative somewhere and it has stuck with me since.

One of the core reasons for gaps in execution is when teams that work together do not adopt this mindset.

A process or platform is a means of getting to the end goal and not the end goal in itself

The end goal always is (and should be) driving business value and creating an exceptional experience for the customers of your company.

A Thread

1. **Do we value speed or intuition?**

> “Deep Blue didn’t win by being smarter than a human; it won by being millions of times faster than a human. Deep Blue had no intuition”

2\. Do we really know how the brain produces a mind?

One of the things I have oft pondered about is what makes you ‘you’. From the perspective of neuroscience what is the ‘seat of consciousness’ in our brain?

It is a question Jeff Hawkins asks in his book “A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence”

> “How do simple cells in the brain create intelligence? “

**3\.** **How do we design the future of AI?**

He talks about how AI scientists try to program computers to act like humans. But do we need to first answer that intelligence is and what it means to ‘understand’ as humans do?

Or move further along from Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) 

4\. Why do we have a sense of self or purpose?

Jeff Hawkins and his team discovered that the brain uses map-like structures to build a model of the world-not just one model, but hundreds of thousands of models of everything we know.

This allows them to answer questions around why we have a sense of self

**5\.** **What is more important to preserve, our genes or our knowledge? Where do we go from here?**

Humans have an old brain and a new one – the old one was driven by the need to survive and replicate. It still does.

The neocortex on the other hand is what has driven us to become an intelligent species.

The question he leaves us with is this one.

> “From this point of view, humans are defined by our intelligence and our knowledge, not by our genes. The choice we face as we think about the future is, should we continue to be driven by our biological past or choose instead to embrace our newly emerged intelligence?”

What is the future you would choose to design?

What can startups learn about product lifecycle from Netflix’ recent Venture Into Gaming

Netflix’s is an interesting case study to all startups on how to own the product lifecycle

Broadening prospects and identifying new revenue streams once they reached the maturity stage

**#Stage1** They started with DVD sales and rentals \[ a now declined and phased out part of the lifecycle\]

**#Stage2** Then moved into subscription services streaming services \[A mature market..\]

**#Stage3** And into Creating Original content with “Netflix Originals” \[a growing space albeit with an influx of new entrants and content glut\]

And now with an influx of companies in this space, Netflix is looking at adding games to streaming platform in the next year

This marks their foray and increased focus on interactive content

They aren’t just a streaming platform competing with HBO or Disney

Rather they are competing for attention in an already content rich environment

Thoughts on Netflix’s strategy?

You could be a people manager or an individual contributor but this holds true nonetheless.

When setting goals for self or the team – Set 2 types of goals

80-20 goals and 50-50 goals

What does that mean?

– A 80-20 goal is one that is 80% likely to get done. It allows realistic completion and provides positive feedback from outcomes achieved

– A 50 – 50 goal is one that is 50% likely to get done. This is a bit of a stretch goal which challenge self/others to stretch the edge of their potentials

Do you know this thing when you are scrolling through mails and intend to get back to some of them.

And then you never do.

Or you do and you need to read again to understand the context.

One of the hacks that works with this is the 2 minute rule.

It is simple – “If it takes less than two minutes, then do it now.”

It means that if you are processing something and it take you less than 2 minutes to take action. Do it right then

People may misinterpret this to mean, take 2 mins to answer the emails whenever they pop up.

No. That will result in context switching

Do this instead.

**#1** Remove notifications if you haven’t already.

**#2** Allocate pomodoros (25 min slots) across the day when you check emails

**#3** If it takes 2 mins or less, do it when you are processing the information

Let me know how this works out.

Have you heard Baz Luhrmann’s Sunscreen Song?

“Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young”, commonly known by the title “Wear Sunscreen” was written as a hypothetical commencement speech by columnist Mary Schmich

As relevant today as it was 10 years ago.

Probably the only thing I had stuck on my walls when in college

**Lyrics**

Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of ’97.  
Wear sunscreen.  
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.  
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience…  
I will dispense this advice now.  
  
Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded.  
But trust me, in 20 years you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked…  
You’re not as fat as you Imagine.  
  
Don’t worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum.  
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind.  
The kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.  
  
Do one thing everyday that scares you.  
  
Sing.  
  
Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts, don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.  
  
Floss.  
  
Don’t waste your time on jealousy;  
Sometimes you’re ahead,  
Sometimes You’re behind.  
The race is long, and in the end, it’s only with yourself.  
  
Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults;  
If you Succeed in doing this, tell me how.  
  
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.  
  
Stretch.  
  
Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your  
Life.  
The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don’t.  
  
Get plenty of calcium.  
  
Be kind to your knees, you’ll miss them when they’re gone.  
  
Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll have children, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll divorce at 40, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary.  
Whatever you do, don’t Congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either.  
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else’s.  
Enjoy your body, Use it every way you can… Don’t be afraid of it, or what other people Think of it,  
It’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own…  
  
Dance… even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.  
  
Read the directions, even if you don’t follow them.  
  
Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.  
  
Brother and sister together we’ll make it through  
Someday your spirit will take you and guide you there  
I know you’ve been hurting, but I’ve been waiting to be there  
For you.  
And I’ll be there, just tell me now, whenever I can.  
Everybody’s free.  
  
Get to know your parents, you never know when they’ll be gone for good.  
  
Be nice to your siblings;  
They are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.  
  
Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on.  
Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.  
  
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard;  
Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.  
  
Travel.  
  
Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will Philander, you too will get old, and when you do you’ll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.  
  
Respect your elders.  
  
Don’t expect anyone else to support you.  
Maybe you have a trust fund, Maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.  
  
Don’t mess too much with your hair, or by the time you’re 40, it will look 85.  
  
Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it’s worth.  
  
But trust me on the sunscreen…

> “Only 22% of companies using machine learning have successfully deployed a model”.

says a Deeplearning(dot)ai report

What makes it so hard? And what do we need to do to improve the situation?

A thread –

**#1** ML is code using data. Not just code.

**#2** Output of the models are dependent on the data it could receive during prediction – a behavior that you cannot completely predict

**#3** Real world data doesn’t come cleaned in a file or table

**#4** Real world problems involve identifying sources, bringing them together and \*trying\* to get them to talk to each other

**#5** So while code development is controlled, data cannot

**#6** What is the outcome : longer deployment times, breakdowns, and impact to performance

**#7** Enter MLOps – MLOps is the intersection of Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Dev-ops (borrowed from a product SDLC ).

The aim is to deploy and maintain ML systems in production reliably

**#8** A successful team ideally should include a datascientist, a Dev-Ops engineer and a Data Engineer. And most importantly work in tandem

**#9** A data scientist alone cannot achieve all the goals of MLOps

**#10** Why should this matter to organizations – hire for complementary skills.

MLOps allows companies to easily deploy, monitor, and update models in production, paving the way to AI with ROI.

Analytics is not magic.

Garbage in. Garbage out.

What is the best piece of advice you have received?

‘You are over-indexed on books . Make time to connect with people to learn more’

We were once discussing an article about how Adobe’s CEO, Shantanu Narayen relies on mentors forged through years of relationships for help in navigating everything

And one of the leaders I look up to mentioned the above comment.

“But I wish I had the time to connect to mentor networks”, I protested.

“Make the time is all I would say”, he repeated.

My parents had post graduate degrees in English literature and worked Government jobs – while they had all the intention to help me with growing in tech, they didn’t know enough.

So before I had mentors I turned to books. For everything I didn’t know.

But I thought about that comment oft.

I still have a way to go but over the last 6 months or so, I have connected with new folks almost every weekend.

Different sectors, age-cohorts and geographies.

On topics varying from tech, startups, fin-tech, neo-banking, women entrepreneurship, how to write a book, angel investing, leadership to financial literacy.

I have left every conversation feeling so humbled by how little I know.

Definitely not dropping books but learning from people’s experiences is amazing!

We usually stick to our comfort zones and people we work with.

You would be surprised at how many people are willing to help if you are open to learning.

Also, if you don’t ask, the answer is always no.

It is one of the advices that would definitely recommend to others too.

The Voice in your head and the stories we tell ourselves

..Why did I miss adding the critical point during the presentation?….

…why hasn’t he called me back yet….

” What I if let her go and she gets hurt…

“As humans, we may talk to ourselves at a rate equivalent to speaking 4,000 words per minute out loud ” says [Ethan Kross](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)

Again. 4,000 words per minute

A University of Michigan professor and the author of “Chatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It.”

Although the inner voice functions well much of the time, it often leads to chatter—

The cyclical negative thoughts and emotions that turn our singular capacity for introspection into a curse rather than a blessing.

He talks about the phonological loop – the element of working memory that transcribes “everything related to words that occurs around us in the present.”

So we have an inner voice and an inner ear. One that guides out attention – one that evaluates us “as we strive for goals,” popping up to assess our progress “like an appointment reminder appearing on your lock screen.” 

We talk to ourselves

And we listen to what we have to say

It recounts the potential hazards of lingering over the negative content – highlighting anecdotes

Like the mental block that ended the pitching career of Major League Baseball’s Rick Ankiel.

“When our minds are bathed in chatter,” Kross writes, “we display a strong bias toward satisfying our emotional needs over our cognitive ones.”

Highly recommend this fascinating read. It is a short \~5 hours on Audible.

A huge take-away for us as parents – your voice as primary care-givers (which in turn is shaped by your culture) is what shapes and becomes the inner voice of the children you raise.

Also, makes one want to be more mindful of the most important conversation we have each day:

The one we have with ourselves.

What is the one thing that top executives do extremely well?

I once asked a senior women leader (I hugely admire) – “Where do you focus your personal energy as you grow as a leader?”

Pat came her answer, ” On Asking Good Questions”

At the outset this may seem surprising since we rise through the ranks ‘because we give good answers’ to problems.

We assume that as we grow, we do so linearly – do more of the same thing. Which isn’t necessarily true.

She mentioned how she trusts her team to execute and her role is not to monitor and project manage but to unblock her team.

Her take was that the top executives ask open exploratory questions to help their teams identify opportunities and explore new directions

“To get a great answer, you need to ask the perfect question”

Curious about what are some great questions that you have asked or have been asked in your careers?

“In Cloud Computing, women make up 14% of the workforce; in Engineering, 20%; and in Data and AI, 32%”

Gender gaps are more likely in sectors that require disruptive technical skills.

What that implies is that even as employers are accelerating their digitalization agenda and automation of jobs, post COVID, there are severe gender gaps that exist in the ‘jobs of tomorrow’.

“The Global Gender Gap Report 2020 examined the share of women in the talent pipeline and found that, far from being able to explain such gender gaps across professions exclusively through a shortage of adequately skilled talent, many of the professions outlined have untapped talent pools”

Being in control over your time is the ultimate freedom.

There are always more things to do than the time one has.

After trying out multiple apps and productivity tools, the one that I have found works the best for me is a plain old journal and a pen

I use what is called ‘Bullet Journaling” to not just be organized but to also get to what Scott Adams calls ‘Systems’ as opposed to Goals.

Most of our thoughts are around things we missed doing, should be doing or plan to be doing.

Putting them down on paper frees up one’s resources to do better stuff that matters!

I took out an hour yesterday to set up the bullet journal for H2 of 2021.

Here are the 7 key things I use it to track

**#DailyLog**

**#MonthlyLog**

**#FutureLog**

**#HabitTracker**

**#Thoughts**

**#Books**

**#Systems** for personal goals

Do you use a mindfulness/productivity tool that helps you plan your day?

“Never Trust. Always Verify” – The evolving Zero Trust Model

A recent IBM-sponsored study demonstrated that the average cost of a single data breach is over $3 million.

One of the latest buzzwords around Cybersecurity is ‘Zero Trust’

What does it mean? And why should you know about it?

Unlike the past where data resides in corporate datacenters, today it resides across locations and devices.

Zero trust is based on the concept of ‘Never trust, always verify’.

As opposed to Traditional IT network security is based on the castle-and-moat approach – where it is hard to obtain access from outside the network, but everyone inside the network is trusted by default.

The problem with this approach is that once an attacker gains access to the network, they have free rein over everything inside.

Zero Trust was created by John Kindervag, during his tenure as a vice president at Forrester Research, based on the realization that traditional security models operate on the outdated assumption that everything inside an organization’s network should be trusted.

The Zero Trust model recognizes that trust is a vulnerability.

Zero trust security requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network

Regardless of whether they are sitting within or outside of the network perimeter.

The core principles include giving users-only as much access as needed, micro segmentation (breaking down security into smaller zones) and multi-factor authentication.

For AI/ML, Zero Trust ensures that sensitive data residing on the cloud can only be accessed by data scientists that are both authenticated and authorized to work with critical sensitive data.

“Face-saving” usually carries a derogatory flavor.

People say, “We are doing that just to let them save face,”

The tone implies ridicule.

This is a grave misunderstanding of the role and importance of face-saving. Especially in working with and managing people.

Face-saving reflects a person’s need to reconcile the stand he takes in a negotiation with his principles

When a judge writes an opinion on a court ruling, he is saving face, not only for himself and for the judicial system, but for the parties.

Instead of just telling one party, “You win,” and telling the other, “You lose,” he explains how his decision is consistent with principle, law, and precedent.

Often in a negotiation, people will continue to hold out not because the proposal on the table is inherently unacceptable, but simply because they want to avoid the feeling or the appearance of backing down to the other side.

Bargaining on the problem and not on positions allows the other party to ‘save face’.

As Carnegie says, to communicate effectively, – ‘Let the Other Person Save Face’.

“Consider this the next time you’re faced with finding fault, issuing threats, or criticizing someone in front of others.

A genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude goes a long way towards alleviating the sting!”

“With great power there must also come great responsibility”

Cheesy though it sounds, Peter Parker principle is on point when it comes to ethics of AI

Increased adoption of AI brings with it an increasing responsibility to consider ethical concerns as a strategic priority.

A PwC analysis proposes 9 ethical principles for organizations to track.

As the WEF report highlights,

“For organization, this is creating a fine line between the potential harm AI might cause and the costs of not adopting the technology”

What comes to your mind when you think of Innovation?

Disruptive products like iPhones?

Drones? Neuralink’s Brain Machine Interfaces?

While all of those are fabulous examples indeed, they are just one flavor of innovation – \*Evolutionary\* innovation.

Thinking of Innovation as also being \*Incremental\* allows us to constantly push boundaries and create better products

Can we create re-usable artifacts that can be used across data science projects?

Do you enable your teams with optimizes processes, data and tech to allow data scientists to do what they do best

Can you have agile frameworks that allows teams to cohesively work together

This is the premise behind Principle 7 – The need to develop many flavors of innovation

Its been a year and a half since we switched to working from home – the online format is here to stay. We have a lot of contact but do we have enough connection

I was listening to Stanford GSB’s ‘Think Fast Talk Smart podcast this morning with [Matt Abrahams](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), [Tina Seelig](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), [Bob Sutton](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Sarah Soule](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)

Here are top takeaways on how to best communicate, share information, and cultivate a professional presence though the screen.

**#FORMAT**

1) “…find ways to reduce cognitive overload,” – Offer information in smaller chunks interspersed with breakout groups.”

2) Have shorter meetings. At [VMware](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), we have switched to 25 mins/50 min formats that allow us breaks before the next connect”

3) Keep content less cluttered and visually appealing

4) We tend to become transactional in virtual interactions – if we want more connection, then we’ve got to make a little bit of time to ask each other, how are you really doing?

**#PRESENCE**

1) How you show up really matters – make sure there’s a little bit of room between your head and the top of your box

2) Be well-lit – people read faces. \[Zoom tip – checkbox adjust for low light\]

3) Raise your camera up so it’s right at your eye level.

4) Use variation in your voice – great way to do this is to add emotive words, adjectives, adverbs, descriptors.

5) Gesture : Ensure your hands are up and visible in the box

6) Leverage paraphrasing – It helps you signal that you’ve heard what somebody said. Highlight or summarize something somebody has said and then add your opinion and link or bridge to the next topic

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Here is a snapshot from VMWare RADIO last week (our an annual, internal conference) which was virtual second year in a row.

Having the screen at eye level is a game changer.

Any tips to own virtual communication?

**#spoileralert**

In a world far into a future – say we are faced with these 4 hypothetical questions. What will you choose to do?

**#1If** you could choose to not see or feel physical beauty for a more equal world, would you choose to do so?

**#2What** if you could increase your intelligence to super human levels – where would you stop. And what would you do to mankind with your gift of super intelligence?

**#3Is** time an illusion. What if alien life comprehended language and time differently from us? Does spoken and written language have to match – or be linear?

**#4What** if the very fundamentals you base your life on is shaken and proved wrong?

Ted Chiang is undoubtedly one of the most deeply intelligent sci-fi authors you can read.

This eight ‘short stories’ including the title that served as the basis for the movie “Arrival.” are beyond sc–fi. They are speculative questions of a world ours could be. An unbeatable combination of nerd appeal and philosophy.

Here are 4 of the ones I absolutely enjoyed – along with fundamentals they question.

**#Story1** “Understand:”

What if you could increase your intelligence to super human levels – where would you stop. And what would you do to mankind with your gift of super intelligence?

“A man who suffered severe brain damage due to a fall through thin ice, is put on an experimental medicine that begins to stimulate neurogenesis on a massive scale. The protagonist becomes preternaturally intelligent, realizes that such super-intelligence is considered a threat, but is able to keep one step ahead of the ordinary minds who pursue him. That is until he runs into another patient who had a similar accident and treatment”

**#Story2** “Division by Zero:”

What if the very fundamentals you base your life on is shaken and proved wrong?

“If a scholar’s life was invested in an idea or way of thinking about the world, but then the scholar proved that that way was in error, might it cause a descent into madness and even a crumbling of one’s world?”

**#Story3** “Story of Your Life:”

Is time an illusion. What if alien life comprehending language and time different from ours? Does spoken and written language have to match – or be linear?

“This is the story that the Amy Adams’ movie “Arrival” is based upon. The protagonist is a linguist charged with helping to communicate with a newly arrived alien species that has a very different approach to language. In the process of learning their language and interacting with them, she begins to see the world as they do – time being an illusion”

**#Story4** “Liking What You See: A Documentary:”

If you could choose to not see or feel physical beauty, would you adopt that?

“This imagines a technology that prevents wearers from being able to recognized beauty (and ugliness as well.) As the subtitle suggests, it’s presented as if it were a documentary that is following a college’s debate over whether to require the student body to use said technology”

Sci-fi is hands-down my favorite genre.

Aiming to be a Zero

(And when you should be a Plus one)

“Whenever you enter a new situation, whether this is a rocket ship or a meeting room or even a fresh personal relationship, you will be viewed as one of three things. “

A Minus One – actively harmful, someone who creates problems.

A Zero – your impact is neutral and doesn’t tip the balance one way or another

A Plus One – someone who actively adds value.

– Chris Hadfield, Canadian Astronaut and Spaceship Commander

We all want to be a Plus One. I have been guilty of it too.

Chris talks about how at first, on a new team or in a new situation, his main goal is to avoid being a net negative contributor. Rather, he seeks to be a “zero.”

But by entering the environment, relationship or meeting room and proclaiming yourself to be a Plus One, you are almost certainly singling yourself out as a Minus One right away.

That’s regardless of the skills and life experiences you may be bringing.

Instead, win their confidence and trust by being a zero.

This means pulling your weight, humbly showing up, not trying to be in the spotlight, doing your job professionally, asking questions, and learning the ropes.

In time you will earn people’s respect and can move from zero to plus contributor and someone that others will want to follow.

This may be the longer play, but it’s far more effective to winning confidence in the long run.

Instead, aim to be a Zero in every new situation. Even if everyone knows that you’re the Plus One.

This is some great advice —be a zero, not a hero.

I thought I wanted to work in Marketing and drive Go-to-market strategy in my first role.

As management trainees, we rotated across roles in the first year and I was assigned as the product manager to drive Product Usage and Retention for my State.

It involved number crunching day in and out – analyzing customer profiles, usage, segmentation, offer and ROI analysis.

Post the first year, we rotated into other roles

I lasted a whole 3 months in marketing before I badgered my boss to put me back with my numbers, analysis that helped drive the product roadmap and help take decisions

Most of the time, we assume we like something and want to do it.

Maybe because we see our peers doing it.

We hear about it

We hear it pays well

We think it sounds like a cool thing to do

I get a dozen messages each day with folks wanting to get into data sciences

Do you have a clear why?

A why that aligns with who you truly are.

Have you ever switched career aspirations?

> Outer space is not the final frontier, our Brain is.

Reverse engineering the human brain may be regarded as the most important project in history.

Is the brain complex? 

In his book, Ray Kurzweil introduces the concept of \*pattern recognition theory of mind\*. (PRTM).

He further draws an analogy to the famous Mandelbrot set, an image that is a symbol of complexity yet it is just a simple 6 character formula applied iteratively.

 To begin with – despite the richness and complexity of human thought-Kurzweil argues that the underlying principles and neuro-networks that are responsible for higher-order thinking are actually relatively simple, and in fact fully replicable.

Indeed, for Kurzweil, our most sophisticated AI machines are already beginning to employ the same principles and are mimicking the same neuro-structures that are present in the human brain.

 I wonder though if the total is bigger than the sum of its parts. 

How does one demystify consciousness and qualia (subjective experiences – “Is my red same as your red? “)

 As always, there are no right answers, but that shouldn’t stop us from asking the right questions. 

Cogito Ergo Sum!

Are people happier by changing their environments?

A new job, a different car, moving countries, maybe a more receptive spouse, a better behaved kid or investments that grow at 14%?

For the longest time I assumed so too.

Asked myself pointless questions – should I have done an MS instead of an MBA? Should we try living out of a different city? et all

It honestly doesn’t matter.

People who win the coveted lottery prize experience high levels of happiness at the time. … The influx of happiness can last about a year but will recede gradually to the normal sense of happiness and well-being

It is called hedonic adaptation. \[Adding the link to the paper in comments\]

Once you have your basic needs met, humans tends to return to their baseline happiness post the initial spike of positivity/negativity.

[Adam Grant](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) talks about this in his latest book, Think again – where he cites the example of a student trying to move colleges with the hope that a ‘different college might make her happier’.

I have been listening to the Daily Gita podcast by Neil Bhatt

He talks about how all experiences are impermanent \[ Chapter 2, verse 16\] – ‘I have sorrow, but I am not sorrowful’.

So whether you follow science or spirituality, be mindful of whether you are constantly chasing rainbows.

Have you noticed instances of hedonic treadmill?

What do you do when people you manage fail?

1. You forgive and forget
2. You remember, pass blame, stigmatize and humiliate them
3. You forgive and remember

The right approach that [Bob Sutton](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Professor of Management at [Stanford University](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) advocates is to \*forgive\* so that people have psychological safety and \*remember\*, so that you can learn, the person can learn and the organization can learn

I recently completed this course from Stanford on ‘Leading Innovation’ led by Robert Sutton on this topic that I highly recommend

The bottom-line remains this – There can be no innovation or learning without failure. Failure sucks but Instructs

One thing we tell every new hire on the team is this –

Try – Iterate- Learn- Improve- Do Better.

‘We have a strategic plan – its called doing things’

Are you providing your teams with psychological safety to succeed?

#reviewswithranjani

Rating – 4/5

Lenin once said, “There are decades when nothing happens and weeks when decades happen.” 

The pandemic is the poster boy for the statement.

To say things have changed – in both work and life is an understatement.

CNN host and best-selling author Fareed Zakaria talks to us about the nature of a post-pandemic world:

The political, social, technological, and economic impacts that may take years to unfold.

It is not a book to breeze through . Will the lessons be relevant long past this pandemic – I think so. It is one of those books that place issues in the larger context

This review covers my 7 key take-aways

I’d like to leave with this quote

> “This should remind us to value the many people whose jobs do not generate huge incomes but are worthwhile, essential, even noble—from scholars and teachers to janitors and street cleaners. The market may not reward them, but we should respect them.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Here are the 10 lessons from the book enumerated across the chapters. 

LESSON ONE — Buckle Up

LESSON TWO — What Matters Is Not the Quantity of Government but the Quality

LESSON THREE — Markets Are Not Enough

LESSON FOUR — People Should Listen to the Experts—and Experts Should Listen to the People

LESSON FIVE — Life Is Digital

LESSON SIX — Aristotle Was Right—We Are Social Animals

LESSON SEVEN — Inequality Will Get Worse)

LESSON EIGHT — Globalization Is Not Dead

LESSON NINE — The World Is Becoming Bipolar

LESSON TEN — Sometimes the Greatest Realists Are the Idealists

CONCLUSION — Nothing Is Written

I took up this course called Semiotics during my post graduation.

If the subject was a person, we’d stand on two extreme ends of a football field, for the left-brained person I was.

I remember the professor showing us an image of a pipe, titled “Ceci n’est pas une pipe”

French for “This is not a pipe.”

I recalled this incident when I came across Shawn Achor’s ‘Science of Happiness’

The core message is simple – “It’s not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality”

The usual assumption is that our external world is a predictor of our happiness, “when in reality, if I know everything about your external world, I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness.

90% of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world”.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* So how do we get the Happiness Advantage?\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Work harder – Be happy and successful is what we are taught.

In fact our brains work in the opposite order.

“If you can raise somebody’s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.

 In fact, we’ve found that every single business outcome improves. Your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed “

So how do you get the Happiness Advantage?

Top 7 mistakes to avoid in the first 90 days – Taken up a new job or new role within the same organization?

**#7TransitionTraps** to avoid

**#1** Sticking to what you know :Doing the same things you did in your previous role, only more so.

**#2** Falling prey to ‘Action Imperative’ : You feel the need to take action, and you try too hard, too early to put your stamp thereby making yourself too busy to learn and taking bad decisions

**#3** Setting unrealistic expectations : You don’t negotiate your mandate or establish clear, achievable objectives

**#4** Attempting to do too much : Rush off in all directions, launching multiple initiatives in the hope that some may pay

**#5** Coming in with ‘the’ answer : You start with your mind made up or reach conclusions quickly about ‘the’ problems and ‘the’ solutions.

**#6** Engaging in the wrong type of learning : Spend too much time focused on technical but not enough on cultural abd political dimensions of the new role

**#7** Neglecting horizontal relationships : Spend too much time with boss and direct reports and not enough on peers and other stakeholders.

Can you think of other mistakes you have seen or experienced when moving into a new role?

How does culture shape the brain?

‘Consider a monkey, bear and a banana’ – which two go together?

My first thought?

The monkey and the banana.

A research I recall reading, uses this example to illustrate how Westerners would say bear and monkey (think categorically and put the animals together) vs East Asians who think relationally (monkey and the food it needs).

What is astounding is the extent to which cultural differences impact our sensory processing!

On Culture and Making Global teams work.

Diversity of thought helps drive huge competitive advantage.

However, geographically dispersed teams face a big challenge: Physical separation and cultural differences can create social distance, or a lack of emotional connection, that can lead to misunderstandings and mistrust.

To help global team leaders manage effectively, [Tsedal Neeley](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)

shares her SPLIT framework for mitigating social distance in HBR

It has five components:

**#1Structure**. If a team is made up of groups with different views about their relative power, the leader should connect frequently with those who are farthest away and emphasize unity.

**#2Process**. Meeting processes should allow for informal interactions that build empathy.

**#3Language**. Everyone, regardless of language fluency, should be empowered to speak up.

**#4Identity**. Team members must be active cultural learners and teachers to understand one another’s identity and avoid misinterpreting behaviors.

**#5Technology**. When choosing between videoconferencing, e-mail, and other modes of communication, leaders should ask themselves if real-time conversation is desirable, if their message needs reinforcement, and if they are opting for the technology they want others to use

Learning to Negotiate is what I call PIVOT skills.

It is one of those high ROI skills that helps you tremendously

Both in your career and in your life

Here are Six Guidelines for “Getting to Yes”

**#1**. Separate the people from the problem.

**#2**. Focus on interests, not positions.

**#3**. Learn to manage emotions.

**#4**. Express appreciation.

**#5**. Put a positive spin on your message.

**#6**. Escape the cycle of action and reaction.

The one I have found the most useful is **#1**

It is easy to forget that our counterparts have feelings, opinions, values, and unique backgrounds that contribute to what they do and say during talks.

For example, if you’re having problems with a generator breaking down repeatedly, don’t say: “Your company makes shoddy equipment,” or “Your service people don’t know what they’re doing.”

Instead, point out: “This is the third time this month that it’s broken down, and disrupted our business. What can we do to improve its reliability? Should we contact another company for a second opinion?”

“Projects fail at a spectacular rate.

One reason is that too many people are reluctant to speak up about their reservations during the planning phase.

By making it safe for dissenters who are knowledgeable and worried to speak up, you can improve a project’s chances of success.”

How can you use pre-mortems to plan better?

**#WHAT**

Pre-mortems – Working backwards from a negative future.

Imagine a headline – “we failed to meet our goal”

It challenges us to think about things that can go wrong which we would otherwise have missed.

**#WHY**

We generally are biased at estimating a positive future since it feels good.

A premortem imagines the opposite — failing to reach your goal — and asks “how did that happen?”

**#HOW**

If a company wanted to double market share in 3 years – the headline would be ‘Company failed to achieve the doubling of share’

Members of the planning team now imagine scenarios – delays in new products, loss of key executives or competition shifts…

And come up with plans to tackle them

This is something one could apply across one’s career and in planning your lives.

This is from this brilliant book ‘Thinking in bets’ – Annie Duke!

Can you think of scenarios where a pre-mortem could have helped a project you were leading?

Whether you do it consciously it or not, you are constantly negotiating at workplaces

For a pay raise, for a different role, a new project or a flexible work schedule

And ‘Negotiation’ is one of those life-skills that every adult should gain a working knowledge

I was reminded of BATNA thanks to Shyam Sadasivan’s brilliant carousel earlier today.

BATNA stands for ‘best alternative to a negotiated agreement’

When you know what you’ll do if you don’t reach a deal, you can compare that possibility to whatever deal is on the table.

The more appealing your best alternative is, the more comfortable you will feel asking for more in your current negotiation

Example – A homebuyer could improve her power in a negotiation with a seller by finding another house she likes just as much.

So before you step into any negotiations, please take the time to identify what is your BATNA

BATNA strategy (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) was first introduced in the book, Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In, Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton (Penguin, 1991) as “the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured.”

What differentiates organizations that see value from AI from those who don’t?

Is there a ‘playbook’ of core practices that ensure success?

[McKinsey & Company](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) recently published a global survey on ‘The state of AI’.

They mapped it down to 6 sets of practices that differentiates the high performing companies from the rest

1. Strategy
2. Talent and Leadership
3. Ways of Working
4. Models, Tools and Technology
5. Data
6. Adoption

It highlights the need to invest in foundational areas and more importantly, the fact that beyond technical areas, the need to focus on the ‘human’ aspect

Whether you are a leader looking at improving the overall analytics acumen in your organization or a professional looking at making a career in this space, highly recommend the report

The Indian rupee is derived from the Rūpaya (silver is called rūpa in Sanskrit)

The Indian currency system transitioned from a bimetallic standard to a gold one in the 1890s.

“The demonetization of silver had a significantly negative effect on the nations using it as a monetary standard.

India witnessed a continuous devaluation of its rupee compared to gold based European countries

By the time India shifted the backing of its rupee to the gold backed pound sterling in 1898, the silver backing its rupee had lost 56% of its value

For China who stayed on the silver standard until 1935, its silver lost 78% of its value

It is the authors’ opinion that the history of China and India and their failure to catch up to the west is inextricably linked to the massive destruction of wealth and capital”

This, he says, is a historical lesson of immense significance to those who think refusal of bitcoin means they don’t have to deal with it.

I am no expert to judge the book – it provides a good foundation to the history to money, rise of bitcoins to various schools of economics (the author isn’t a fan of the Keynes model)

Would to hear perspectives from those who are better informed on the topic

In 12th, I scored around 97% in Science and Math. I was sure I would study medicine  
  
It seemed possible going by the previous year’s cut-off scores. So my parents and I went to the Common Entrance Cell hoping to score a ‘free’ General Merit seat within the city.  
  
Why not outside?  
  
Because my parents had apparently heard of horror stories of how it was unsafe for girls with rampant ragging.  
  
Long story short, the person a couple of places ahead of me, picked the last one in Bangalore.  
  
I refused to budge hoping for a miracle. None happened.  
  
A month after I started my engineering degree, my mom got back from work, utterly upset about having been misled,  
  
Apparently, she had taken the advice of her senior at her government job, who had a son in his 2nd year of medicine.  
  
Who now scornfully called out that while it was alright for my mom to dream big, it was ridiculous to imagine she could have her daughter in the same position as that of his son.  
  
No, I don’t regret my Hobson’s choice.  
  
The point is – Whenever possible, seek out knowledge.  
  
Do not buy bitcoins because Elon tweeted so.  
Or pick a data science course because a cousin said it is the next hot thing.  
  
Do your research.

Contextual intelligence for career growth – 12 behaviors to know where you stand

‘The most successful people are usually characterized as being able to see things clearly in a way that few others do

This ability has little to do with being brilliant academically

Rather being able to understand change, adapt to it and know how to use it, so that instead of affecting you, it helps you to improve’

Matthew Kutz, a psychology professor at Texas State University,

established up to 12 associated behaviors:

1\. Future mentality: you like to progress and you are very clear about what you want to achieve.

2\. Ability to influence: you use interpersonal skills to positively and non-coercively affect the actions and decisions of others.

3\. Social responsibility: you express concern about social trends and problems.

4\. Cultural sensitivity: you promote and favour diversity in a variety of contexts.

5\. Multicultural leadership: you can influence the behaviours and attitudes of peers within an ethnically diverse context.

6\. Context analysis: you know how to interpret and react appropriately to a changing and volatile environment.

7\. Change agent: you have the courage to ask tough questions and are proactive in facing challenges, leading, participating or making changes.

8\. Constructive use of influence: you use interpersonal skills and your personal influence to constructively and effectively affect the behaviour and decisions of others.

9\. Analysis of your knowledge: you evaluate your own work and are aware of your strengths and weaknesses.

10\. Critical thinking: you are able to establish connections or relationships between different areas, fields or environments, thereby obtaining novel points of view and opinions, which are not usually reached by the majority.

11\. Consensus builder: you display interpersonal skills and convince others to see a different point of view through the use of listening skills, conflict management and creating win-win situations.

12\. Mission awareness: in environments where a certain level of hierarchy can occur, you understand and are able to show how the individual performance of others influences the perception of colleagues, subordinates and managers.

How many of these do you use?

5 Do’s and Don’ts for data scientists/analytics professionals looking for a new role

1. If you do not know the hiring manager/person who can refer you – please don’t bombard people with ‘Hi’ messages on Linkedin.
2. Do your homework upfront. Research about the company and roles they offer. Check out their careers page to identify open roles.
3. Evaluate your why – why do you want a career in this space? What are your key skills – are you great at visualization, storytelling or building pipelines?
4. Alignment to Role – Do your skillsets align with what is being offered? Again, do not aim for a 100% match.
5. Do you have a portfolio of work that can showcase how you can add tangible value to the requisite role?

Now you can reach out to people within the organizations requesting for a referral.

Share a summary of what role you are keen to apply, why and how you think you can add value upfront.

Being enterprising and focused alone differentiates you from the other 80% who aren’t.

Any other tips?

Wake up 5AM vs at 9AM

Gold medalist vs ‘Academics doesn’t matter’

Reading 52 books vs Learn from doing than reading

Planning each day vs I like to wing it

Can’t finish 100 years of solitude vs I love Gabriel García Márquez

I constantly see such opposing views on my feed. One usually dissing the verity of the other.

There is no right or wrong way – they are all successful people

People. Contexts. Environment. Societies we live in.

Are all different.

With fewer opportunities vs supply, I had to do well in academics to differentiate self and get my first job.

I have stayed up until 12 with a colicky kid, feeling guilty about missing my 5AM meditation

Don’t let a stranger with a different life narrative define rules for you.

Learn from patterns of successful folks. Don’t blindly follow rules.

“Waking up at 5 AM” is a rule.

“Understand before being understood” is a pattern/mental model.

Learn the difference.

And do what works best for you.

13 skills every adult should have a working knowledge of

“I made a list of skills in which I think every adult should gain a working knowledge.

I wouldn’t expect you to become a master of any, but mastery isn’t necessary.

Luck has a good chance of finding you if you become merely good in most of these areas.

I’ll make a case for each one, but here’s the preview list.

**#1** Public speaking

**#2** Psychology

**#3** Business Writing

**#4** Accounting

**#5** Design (the basics)

**#6** Conversation

**#7** Overcoming Shyness

**#8** Second language

**#9** Golf

**#10** Proper grammar

**#11** Persuasion

**#12** Technology ( hobby level)

**#13** Proper voice technique”

I found this list (and the book) quite intriguing.

“When the Black Death plague entered England in 1348, the Scots up north laughed at their good fortune.

With the English crippled by disease, now was a perfect time for Scotland to stage an attack on its neighbor.

The Scots huddled together thousands of troops in preparation for battle.

Which, of course, is the worst possible move during a pandemic.

“Before they could move, the savage mortality fell upon them too, scattering some in death and the rest in panic,” historian Barbara Tuchman writes in her book A Distant Mirror.

There’s a powerful urge to think risk is something that happens to other people.

Other people get unlucky, other people make dumb decisions, other people get swayed by the seduction of greed and fear.

But you?

Me?

No, never us.

False confidence makes the eventual reality all the more shocking.

Some are more susceptible to risk than others, but no one is exempt from being humbled.”

[Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/) is quite a super star.

He is one of those people Tim Ferriss mentioned in his podcast around 5 years ago that I still recall.

Because he wrote one of the most brilliant posts I have ever come across that I recommend everyone reads – [1000 True fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)

He shares what he calls ‘unsolicited bits of advice’ on his birthdays.

This is great advice for life in general

Here is his list. For other such content check out his blog [here ](https://kk.org/)

1. Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe.
2. Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.
3. Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.
4. Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.
5. Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until there is no more.
6. A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.
7. Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.
8. Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends.
9. Don’t trust all-purpose glue.
10. Reading to your children regularly will bond you together and kickstart their imaginations.
11. Never use a credit card for credit. The only kind of credit, or debt, that is acceptable is debt to acquire something whose exchange value is extremely likely to increase, like in a home. The exchange value of most things diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase them. Don’t be in debt to losers.
12. Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.
13. Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed.
14. Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.
15. Rule of 3 in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth.
16. Don’t be the best. Be the only.
17. Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
18. Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.
19. The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.
20. Promptness is a sign of respect.
21. When you are young spend at least 6 months to one year living as poor as you can, owning as little as you possibly can, eating beans and rice in a tiny room or tent, to experience what your “worst” lifestyle might be. That way any time you have to risk something in the future you won’t be afraid of the worst case scenario.
22. Trust me: There is no “them”.
23. The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.
24. Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.
25. To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.
26. The Golden Rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues.
27. If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.
28. Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.
29. To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.
30. Never get involved in a land war in Asia.
31. You can obsess about serving your customers/audience/clients, or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two, obsessing about your customers will take you further.
32. Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up.
33. Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.
34. If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting.
35. Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom.
36. Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.
37. This is true: It’s hard to cheat an honest man.
38. When an object is lost, 95% of the time it is hiding within arm’s reach of where it was last seen. Search in all possible locations in that radius and you’ll find it.
39. You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.
40. If you lose or forget to bring a cable, adapter or charger, check with your hotel. Most hotels now have a drawer full of cables, adapters and chargers others have left behind, and probably have the one you are missing. You can often claim it after borrowing it.
41. Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.
42. There is no limit on better. Talent is distributed unfairly, but there is no limit on how much we can improve what we start with.
43. Be prepared: When you are 90% done any large project (a house, a film, an event, an app) the rest of the myriad details will take a second 90% to complete.
44. When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation.
45. Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen. Nobody talks about the departed’s achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving.
46. For every dollar you spend purchasing something substantial, expect to pay a dollar in repairs, maintenance, or disposal by the end of its life.
47. Anything real begins with the fiction of what could be. Imagination is therefore the most potent force in the universe, and a skill you can get better at. It’s the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring what everyone else knows.
48. When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress.
49. On vacation go to the most remote place on your itinerary first, bypassing the cities. You’ll maximize the shock of otherness in the remote, and then later you’ll welcome the familiar comforts of a city on the way back.
50. When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will pass that immediacy filter.
51. Don’t say anything about someone in email you would not be comfortable saying to them directly, because eventually they _will_ read it.
52. If you desperately need a job, you are just another problem for a boss; if you can solve many of the problems the boss has right now, you are hired. To be hired, think like your boss.
53. Art is in what you leave out.
54. Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will.
55. Rule of 7 in research. You can find out anything if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn’t know, ask them who you should ask next, and so on down the line. If you are willing to go to the 7th source, you’ll almost always get your answer.
56. How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely.
57. Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise.
58. When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have empathy toward them which can soften the conflict.
59. Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures.
60. You really don’t want to be famous. Read the biography of any famous person.
61. Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time.
62. A vacation + a disaster = an adventure.
63. Buying tools: Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.
64. Learn how to take a 20-minute power nap without embarrassment.
65. Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is “master something, anything”. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is.
66. I’m positive that in 100 years much of what I take to be true today will be proved to be wrong, maybe even embarrassingly wrong, and I try really hard to identify what it is that I am wrong about today.
67. Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists. To be an optimist you don’t have to ignore all the many problems we create; you just have to imagine improving our capacity to solve problems.
68. The universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. This will be much easier to do if you embrace this pronoia.

[Chitra Gurjar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA8CHoBclXblc9YDRlsyMllBd1bhFIcpTs) and I recently had a great conversation on her podcast ‘Software People Stories’ about a myriad topics….

Human-centered AI and Tech, leadership, how product management complements my analytics role, being comfortable with ambiguity…. to my dad who will always my north-star

and of-course books!

And most importantly a topic that I increasingly realize is part of my core value and passion – Daring Greatly and enabling other women to take charge of their lives.

Absolutely nothing – not where you hail from or your gender should define what one can or cannot do

Have you heard the story of how Airbnb funded their startup with cereal boxes.

So I heard this oh-so-smart story of how AirBnB emerged from the cusp of doom in Guy Raz’ book – ‘How I built this’

After their failed attempt at getting people to book through Air Bed and Breakfast (as it was then called), they took upon one last chance that their maxed out credit cards afforded.

It was the 2008 Obama-McCain Election

They had this really crazy idea…

Design and sell limited edition cereal boxes and call them Obama O’s & Captain McCain.

They contacted a print shop and had 1,000 custom boxes printed.

They, then, bought a ton of Cheerios and Captain Crunch. And, finally, they put the boxes together with a hot glue gun in their apartment and slapped a $40 price tag on them.

As luck would have it, they got featured on national television and in 24-hours sold 1,000 cereal boxes and with it… pocketed $30,000 in profit.

Profit that helped them pay off the 20K credit card debt they had accumulated

The hustle and agency they showed in times of crises is so mind-blowing.

Trust your crazy ideas

Check out the for the images of the cereal boxes here

Can the post COVID world address income inequality in supercities?

There are three trends that the a16z report addresses in this respect – albeit from a US lens

**#1Supercities** and the Workforce — and how it ties to inequality. Think cities such as San Francisco. Or in India – Bangalore.

Think about the impact of geographic concentration of jobs, innovation, and thereby economic growth

**#2VentureCapital** and Innovation

“In 2020, just three regions — the Bay Area, New York, and Massachusetts — accounted for 70%+ of total venture funding in the U.S.

**#3R**&D Investments and Impact to productivity

Government spending on public R&D also correlates with the highest wage-earning metropolitan areas

“These R&D investments matter because they enhance productivity, which enables the formation of new (and often higher-wage) jobs.”

“For every 1% increase in productivity, wages for low-skilled workers rise at roughly double the rate of those for high-skilled workers”

Would the post-COVID decoupling pf workforce from location, tech that powers Work 2.0 and R&D investments outside of clustered hubs address economic inequality, innovation, opportunities and productivity?

Rating – 3.75/5

This is another brilliant book from Adam Grant.

In THINK AGAIN, Adam Grant brings together research and anecdotes to help us learn how to stay need to stay curious. It pushes us to reconsider, rethink, reevaluate and reimagine our beliefs, thoughts, and identities and get to the core of why we believe what we do

The core message of this book is to think like a scientist. Always seeking new information, challenging existing beliefs including your own, running experiments to test your hypotheses and being a lifelong learner.

It is a book about how we can get better at embracing the unknown and the joy of being wrong

I love Grant’s writing and this is a really engaging book.

Here are 4 parts I want to leave you with

Part 1 : Should we pursue happiness or purpose in life

Part 2 : What are the default mindsets we resort to when we think or talk? And why we should avoid them

Part 3: How to win debates and influence people?

Part 4 : Identity foreclosure and reconsidering our best laid out plans

“Planning is Guessing  
  
Unless you are a fortune teller, long-term business planning is a fantasy.  
  
There are too many factors that are out of your hands – market conditions, competitors, customers, economy etc.  
  
Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can’t actually control. At best, it is guess work.  
  
It tells us “This is where we are going because well, that’s where we said we are going”. Plans are inconsistent with improvisation.  
  
It doesn’t mean you should not think about the future – just not obsess over it. Plans more than a few pages long just wind up as fossils.  
  
Decide what you are going to do this week – not over years”  
  
This is one of topics addressed in this book that is filled with no-jargons-just-simple-rules-for-success.  
  
I am glad I picked up this relatively-unknown non-nonsense book about changing the way one works. Thanks to [Ankur Warikoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABOlvUB-6uQpj5VtIz3pACOBVaAzOdTRBA)‘s recommendation.  
  
And that is my Friday Book recommendation for the week.

Do you know that feeling of Guilt combined with Fear?

The kind that envelops you when you know you are wasting time glued to your screen instead of studying for an impending exam.

That probably is normal \[and requisite\] if there is a exam to write the next day.

I felt that almost on a regular basis when my mind identified me being involved in activities I classified as ‘not productive’.

While it may seem like being productive and constantly learning is a good thing – humans need down-time.

Time doing nothing.

I haven’t felt the need for the downtime as much as I did over this last year.

I realized I was fatigued by the end of the day – something I never really felt earlier. I was trying to do too many things.

I stopped to reassess my priorities and non-negotiables – sleep, meditation or working out.

Here is a reminder to all to learn to recognize stress, being more mindful and rather than adding initiatives – to pick ones that really matter.

And most importantly, have time slotted in your calendars to do nothing.

Reminded me of this poem from 4th grade

Leisure – WH. Davies

And it works.

Gearing up for a huge presentation, interview or game? – Doing this one thing will definitely improve your chances.

What is it?

Preparation prior to the event using simulations of various possible scenarios and outcomes.

#1Simulate the Worst-Case and all potential scenarios

#2Visualize and Prepare for Failure

You can learn as much as possible from simulations, and how astronauts prepare.

There is no snake oil here – just sheer hard \[and smart work\] to success.

TL:DR :

1. Why choose Data sciences – Why does it matter to you?
2. “Not all Data scientists are the same” – How do identifying areas that align to your strengths
3. Did you know? – Day in the life of a data scientist
4. Be an artist, not a painter
5. Create a portfolio
6. Making a transition or a break into the space as a beginner
7. Solve Problems

The video opens with the view of a monkey perched high on a stool in front of a screen.

He has Neuralink placed on each side of his brain and has learnt to interact with the computer in return for a banana smoothie delivered through a straw

Half way through we see the money playing ping pong

There is no joy stick

He is controlling the cursor entirely with decoded neural activity.

When is the best time to network?

When you don’t need to.

We default to staying within our cohorts

Teams. Age. Domain. Geographies. Expertise.

As you talk to people at your company beyond your teams, in your industry or even outside your field of interest, you uncover connections and opportunities accelerating your learning.

You can connect the dots faster

It makes you noticeable and increased your creative intellect

And when you decide to start – do not start by asking for favors.

Be authentic – Start with Giving and Being Curious.

With a mindset to learn and offer value.

That is how I found most of my mentors – there are some genuinely nice people out there.

So where can you start?

Block your Friday afternoons to have at least one conversation with someone new within your organizations.

Play the long term game.

On Preparation and the Power of Negative Thinking : The Story of an Astronaut, Elton John and getting ready to play ‘RocketMan’

“Yes, I was flying airplanes and air shows in Canada

And Elton John was flying in that day to do a concert in Windsor, Ontario

And I thought the odds were extremely small, but they were convinced that we were going to meet Elton John.

I went OK, what’s the worst thing that could happen?

I meet Elton John, and Elton John and I are talking, and he finds out that not only am I an astronaut, but maybe he loves astronauts, and he wants the astronaut to come up onstage.

What would be the only thing that might happen if he finds out that an astronaut who’s up on stage with him plays guitar

What song could they play together – “Rocket Man.”

So that afternoon I sat down and learned “Rocket Man.”

In the slim chance that the worst case scenario were to happen, I wanted to be prepared.

And what happened was we did actually meet Elton John

He turned out to be a really nice guy. But fortunately for both of us, I never ended up onstage playing “Rocket Man”

But my whole life, I’ve been getting ready to play “Rocket Man,”

And sometimes it works out for the best”

– Astronaut Chris Hadfield

Are you preparing for your Rocketman?

What are the Time-twisting, Mind-bending and Craziest books you have read in your life?

Imagine you woke up one morning and discovered that your entire life – your job, your kids, your friends, all your experiences – wasn’t real.

It still feels real. You remember it vividly. But you also suddenly remember another life; your real life. 

Are we really happy? What if we made different decisions in life?

What if we could live out choices we never made but wished we did?

Very few books have this mind-bending quality to them – have you sit up until 2 AM in the morning or make you feel tiny and overwhelmed.

It resonates with life’s big ‘what-if’ questions one asks self the night before one graduates out of college or before a huge life event

I discovered Blake Crouch’s novels this week, during my time off

And then stay through the emotionally charged ride over the 2 days it took to finish the two novels.

Be it the quantum fiction, multi-verses posited on Schrödinger’s cat in Dark Matter or the Neuroscience behind time travel, memory and death in Recursion – it is reads like Black Mirror in text.

Intense, Convoluted and Unputdownable

“Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards”

Here is a fun Wednesday quiz to understand your default thinking mode

If someone tells me a belief I’ve held for a long time is wrong, my first instinct is to…

#1 Disregard them altogether

#2 Consider the best way to make a good impression

#3 Demolish their reasoning

#4 Be curious about what I don’t know

#5 Start craving some avocado toast

Did you share your answer in comments?

Like most of you mine was a combination.

Between 4, 1 and sometimes 3, in that order – depending on the topic and the person at the other end.

This is from Adam Grant’s latest book – Think Again – The power of knowing what you don’t know

He says that in our daily lives, we often think like preachers, prosecutors, politicians, and scientists.

Psychologists find that we enter preacher mode when we’re defending a sacred value, prosecutor mode when we’re trying to win an argument, politician mode when we’re campaigning for the approval of an audience, and scientist mode when we’re searching for the truth.

These mental modes affect our will to question our own opinions and our skill to open other people’s minds.

So where do you fall in the spectrum – a preacher, prosecutor, politician or a scientist?

If there is one critical skill to grow as a leader, what would that be?

Connecting the dots and Interpreting information

Large organizations are complex.

There is humongous amount of information and teams.

Instead of just seeing and looking out for what one expects, synthesizing information across all the inputs one is an essential skill.

Most of the times, we wait for things to happen. To be told.

And given a map.

Recognizing patterns, pushing through ambiguity and understanding implications across stakeholders is critical

For this, we need to start connecting the dots. Be inquisitive and seek information.

Think beyond what you are told. Solve problems for your organization

What do you see as essential leadership skills?

What if your body were to be swapped whilst retaining the conscious, will that still be you?

What makes you you?

That is a question asked in John Scalzi’s sci-fi thriller, Old Man’s War

Is it your consciousness that makes you you?

If so, what exactly is consciousness, and how can we study it through the brain?

In 1976, Francis Crick arrived at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, overlooking a Pacific Shangri-La with cotton candy skies and a beaming, blue-green sea.

He hoped to win another Nobel do the same thing for consciousness.

Can we identify consciousness with neural activity?

On his deathbed in 2005, Crick, published a final article -it proposed the claustrum, a set of neurons coincidentally shaped like a hammock, as the seat of consciousness

It took a few more years to show that the claustrum may not be the seat of consciousness, but it could still be a kind of chauffeur for it.

It is a question that still continues to puzzle neuroscientists

“It’s just that difficult to imagine how subjective experience can arise from basic physical elements like atoms and molecules”

What do you think makes you, you?

This International Women’s day, amidst all the flurry of activity, I had a leader I look up to reach out to put together a collage of interviews across 8 leaders

In his own words – 

“8th March is International Woman’s Day!

Back in 2020, to celebrate Woman’s Day, I decided to reach out to 8 woman leaders and ask them two questions on leadership and advice.

It was an attempt on my part to give respect to some of the amazing women leaders I knew – ranging from women in my family to my college mates to work colleagues and some women that I had recently met and been impressed with”

257 years

That is the estimated number of years it will take to achieve gender parity and close the economic gender gap

At the current rates of progress, as per the World Economic Forum \[WEF\] report.

Not in my daughters’ lifetime

Nor in her grandchild’s lifetime.

I was attending a Women @ VMWare session last evening, when this alarming statistic was shared.

The WEF report highlights three primary reasons for this:

#Women have greater representation in roles that are being automated  
#Not enough women are entering professions where wage growth is the most pronounced (most obviously, but not exclusively, technology)  
#Women face the perennial problem of insufficient care infrastructure and access to capital.

Why does gender parity matter?

It has a fundamental bearing on whether or not economies and societies thrive.

What can you do about it?

As the session speaker so eloquently put it – ‘Pick just 2 people to start with and think about how you can help them’

Advocate, champion and mentor where possible. Raise strong daughters.

Our children deserve a level playing field.

Achieving gender equality is everyone’s responsibility.

Genre – Financial Markets, Math, Investing

#reviewswithranjani#podshortschallenge

Rating – 4/5

I can’t better this NYT article opening so will use this –

There are few books in the investing world as well known as [Burton Malkiel’s “A Random Walk Down Wall Street.”](https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/news/3065417/burton-malkiel-believe-indexing-strongly-wrote-random-walk-wall-street) . That is not what we will talk about Its thesis is that “a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by the experts.”

To put it another way, the market is so efficient that even professional investors have little chance of beating it on a regular basis.

Jim Simons is not a blindfolded monkey. A former code-breaker for the United States government and a brilliant mathematician, Simons founded the most successful investment firm the world has ever seen.

As [Gregory Zuckerman](https://www.gregoryzuckerman.com/) notes in today’s book we are going to review “The Man Who Solved the Market,” even Warren Buffett’s track record — 20.5 percent annualized returns since 1965 — doesn’t approach Simons’s average of 39 percent gains over a three-decade span. And that’s _after_ his company has taken a 5 percent management fee and 44 percent of the profits.

The question has always been: How does Simons do it?

Jim Simons is the greatest money maker in modern financial history. No other investor–Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, or George Soros–can touch his record. Since 1988, Renaissance’s signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent. The firm has earned profits of more than $100 billion; Simons is worth twenty-three billion dollars.

Thus reads the introduction to one of the most thought provoking books that I have read this year – The book we are talking about is “The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant revolution”

A veteran Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, tells the gripping story of how a world-class mathematician and former code breaker mastered the market.

Simons pioneered a data-driven, algorithmic approach that’s today is sweeping the world. And he did so at an age that it was first ridiculed.

Here are three tropes that characterize the book for me

1. “All animals are equal. But some are more equal than others”

What struck me the most about this book beyond the wild figures of money people made and a male dominated field was the different bubbles’ people occupy around the world.

I couldn’t but help recollect a conversation I had with my government employee retired mom who was so keen that I recheck her savings to ensure she was paying taxes on her fixed deposits to the last penny. ‘We don’t evade taxes’ she said surreptitiously.

And then there are people at Renaissance who run out of ideas with what one could do with massive amounts of wealth.

And what keeps people out. Knowledge and access to growing wealth

2) Driving the shift from manual financial expertise to leveraging math to understand market mechanics

Looking at companies or sectors is irrelevant. Renaissance enjoyed huge returns by simply sifting Big Data. Humans are irrelevant. The companies they command are mere replaceable cogs in a language of financial numbers.

“We’re right 50.75 percent of the time . . . but we’re 100 percent right 50.75 percent of the time,” Mercer told a friend. “You can make billions that way.”

Jimmy Simons and Robert Mercer were mathematicians. Neither knows all that much about financial markets, but they know about data, raw information from a staggering array of sources, within which are hidden patterns

He helped pioneer quantitative investing, relying on complex computer programs rather than human judgment, to make trading decisions

3) How one could be a scientist and yet question climate change and impact the world beyond the financial markets

As the book introduction reads – as Renaissance became a market force, its executives began influencing the world beyond finance. Simons became a major figure in scientific research, education, and liberal politics.

And then there is the question of how the the liberal leaning Jim Simons, , thought of the co-head of his firm, Robert Mercer.

Senior executive Robert Mercer who apart from questioning climate change is more responsible than anyone else for the 2016 presidency

In conclusion, I’ll conclude with these thoughts from the NYT article on the topic –

“When you get right down to it, Simons makes money because human behavior will never be completely “efficient.” Those short-term anomalies Simons — and other quants — unearth exist because humans have always acted emotionally.

I’ll leave you with one of Zuckerman’s final thoughts:

> “For all the unique data, computer firepower, special talent and trading and risk-management expertise Renaissance has gathered, the firm only profits on barely more than 50 percent of its trades, a sign of how challenging it is to try to beat the market — and how foolish it is for most investors to try.

In other words, stick to index funds”

Such an absolutely fascinating book!

Have you heard the story of the guy who traded a paper clip to a house?

Kyle MacDonald did exactly that

He traded up from one red paperclip to a house, in only a year through 14 trades!

It’s an unlikely and amazing journey with lots of surprises along the way documented in his blog nearly 15 years ago.

I was reading Stanford’s D.School’s Tina Seelig highlight this example for creating value in her ‘Entrepreneurship and Innovation’ course where we she highlighted this example.

𝗖𝗮𝗻, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗜 𝗱𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝘄𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱

And that statement is quite relevant in the space of 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗜.

Humans are the ones who decide what the machine should be maximizing.

Are we taking a human-centered approach and understanding the limitations of the data set and model?

Have you heard of Nick Bostrom’s famous paperclip maximiser example that illustrates this?

“A Paperclip Maximizer is a hypothetical artificial intelligence \[AGI\]

It’s utility function values maximizing the number of paperclips in the universe.

The paperclip maximizer is an thought experiment showing how an AGI, even one designed competently and without malice, could pose existential threats.

It would innovate better and better techniques to maximize the number of paperclips.

At some point, it might transform “first all of earth and then increasing portions of space into paperclip manufacturing facilities”.

For those who are interested I have the link to Nick Bostrom’s paper on Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence below

Tip 7 – Before you start, figure out if it’s a hard skill or a soft skill.

Hard Skills – Repeatable precision required. Think Robots.

Specifically found in specialized pursuits – physical sport, for example.

In such cases – “Always be consistent”

Soft Skills – Highly flexible skills.

Those that have many paths to a good result.

It is more about being agile and interactive.

About recognizing patterns as they unfold and making smart, timely choices.

This is found in broader, less specialized pursuits. Example – involving communication, stock trading or a CEO reading a room

Here is a litmus test to identify the category

If a teacher/coach is involved in the early stages, it is more likely a hard skill.

What would I recommend to my 20 year old self?

Someone I mentor asked me this recently.

Counter-intuitive as it sounds, I would say invest in holistic personality development vs. only stellar academic credentials.

Being the nerd that I was, I spent every spare minute poring over books, fighting with professors over the 2 marks lost, skipping anything that didn’t come with credits and sticking to others of my kind.

While I could have put myself out there, networked with people different from myself \[who, by the way, turned out super successful\], learnt to see things from their perspective, asked why more often, picked a hobby or a sport and most importantly, chilled out a bit.

Yes – good academics matters.

In real world though, outcomes matter more than outputs.

And that is learnt beyond the pages of a book.

What is your advice to your 20 year old self?

Why do a majority of AI Projects fail ?

4 Key Reasons and what Leaders and Practitioners can do about it

I spoke at WiDS Kerala yesterday addressing one of the conundrum’s we see – why do we have 9 out of 10 agreeing that AI represents a business opportunity but 7 out of 10 companies see minimal impact from AI.

“Dare Mighty Things” was the hidden message on NASA’s Mars rover parachute.  
  
It was a phrase used first by Theodore Roosevelt, the 26 President of United States.  
  
It also is a mantra at Jet Propulsion Lab  
  
Systems engineer Ian Clark at JPL used a binary code to spell out “Dare Mighty Things” in the orange and white strips of the 70-foot (21-meter) parachute.  
  
Clark, a crossword hobbyist, came up with the idea two years ago when the Engineers wanted an unusual pattern in the nylon fabric to know how the parachute was oriented during descent.  
  
Once they put out a teaser about the cryptic encoded message, it took a few hours for the internet fans to figure it out.

How fantastic is that message?

If Aliens existed, how will we find them?

If you think about it, most sci-fi narratives are thought experiments exploring ‘what if’ we stretched the limits of humankind

It is my favorite genre.

Let’s think specifically about the future of space exploration.

Successful missions such as Viking, Cassini, New Horizons, Juno, and Rosetta were all done with last-century technology.

We can realistically expect that during this century, the entire solar system—planets, moons, and asteroids—will be explored.

Here are some thoughts from Nautilus on the topic-

1. Most of these may not be a manned spaceflight
2. The privately funded ventures such as SpaceX and Blue Origin bring in a silicon culture to the national space agencies driven era
3. Interplanetary travel will and is impeded by chemical fuels of today that limit the payload – nuclear power could be transformative. \[cue – ‘space elevators’\]
4. The pioneer explorers who seek to terraform other planets to make it habitable
5. Technological advances to intelligent beings are instant compared to Darwinian evolution scales but would it account for consciousness

Such an exciting time for my daughter to grow up to!

Any sci-fi fans out here? Drop a comment!

Would you accept a one-way ticket to Mars?

Apply to that job even if you think you don’t have 100% of the requirements met

Here are 5 reasons why

\[1\] There is no perfect candidate for the JD.

\[2\] As a hiring manager, many, including I, look at attitude and integrity over hard skills \[that can be taught\]

\[3\] Give yourself room to grow – As the adage goes, if you are the smartest person in the room – you are in the wrong room.

\[4\] Identify key skills you do check-box across the requirements vs a 100% fit.

\[5\] Apply to jobs that are aspirational and you are qualified for. Explain how you are working towards filling up the gaps that may be present.

The concern is further aggravated in women

A LinkedIn research found that women on average apply for fewer positions, and in particular for less senior positions.

Women were:

##Less likely to apply for positions they had viewed on the website

##Less likely to apply for positions that were more senior than their current position (what LinkedIn call ‘stretch roles’)

##More likely to be hired when compared to men applying for the same position as them

Thoughts?

Improving Productivity doesn’t imply putting more hours at work. Or pushing your teams to.

Instead of resulting in greater output, longer hours lead to stress, a significant cause of both physical and mental health issues.

This “productivity paradox” is countered by research that shows overwhelmingly that scheduling downtime actually makes you more productive.

3 steps to shift your mind-set into being more productive with fewer hours

**#1Start** your work with a 15 mins plan-your-day. Although you may have a bias for action, creating a brief plan before diving into work actually makes you more productive.

**#2Trick** yourself into getting started using the Zeigarnik Effect – to avoid inertia and the overwhelm of the task to get to you, just focus on the small first step – write the first para of the report or send that email.

It works by having you jump into a project knowing that you don’t need to complete it right away.

**#3Build** Habits, not Goals. Set aside an hour at the start of the day for deep-work. Remove notifications and check emails at scheduled times. Creating routines removes the role of the \[diminishing\] will-power

The Doctor Will Sniff You Now

It’s 2050 and you’re due for your monthly physical exam.

Times have changed, so you no longer have to endure an orifices check, a needle in your vein, and a week of waiting for your blood test results.  
Instead, the nurse welcomes you with, “The doctor will sniff you now,” and takes you into an airtight chamber wired up to a massive computer.

As you rest, the volatile molecules you exhale or emit from your body and skin slowly drift into the complex artificial intelligence apparatus, colloquially known as Deep Nose.

Deep Nose’s massive electronic brain starts crunching through the molecules, comparing them to its enormous olfactory database.

Deep Nose is intended to match your odors to the medical conditions that cause them.

Your human doctor goes over the results with you and plans your treatment or adjusts your meds.

What can one’s odor tell about one’s health?  
Apparently, a lot.

“Our evolution may not have designed us to diagnose disease,” Koulakov says, “but we can design a software that can do so.”

How fascinating is that?

> “When Ideas survive – it is not because that is true, but because they are interesting”

In a classic paper, sociologist Murray Davies argued the above.

What makes an idea interesting is that it challenges our weakly held opinions

For example, did you know the Moon May Have Formed When Earth’s Magma Was Blasted into Space.

When an idea doesn’t matter deeply to us, we are often excited to question it.

The natural sequence of emotions is – Surprise \[“Really”\] -> followed by Curiosity \[“Tell me more”\] and Thrill \[“Wow”\]

But when a core belief if questioned – we begin to shut down that to open up.

Refuse to let you beliefs become part of your identity.

There are two types of detachments that are critical in life –

Detaching your present from your past and detaching your opinions from your identity

– From the chapter on “The joy of being wrong : The thrill of not believing everything you think”

– Think Again by Adam Grant

Are you open to changing your mind when the facts change?

You may not choose to stay at a job just for the salary, but you won’t stay in the job if there is no salary.

Your remuneration at work is thus a “hygiene factor”

The only thing I remember from my Organizational Behavior Class almost a decade ago is “**Herzberg’s Two Factor theory of motivation”**

It argues that there are two factors that an organization can adjust to influence motivation in the workplace.

1. **Motivators**: Which can encourage employees to work harder.
2. **Hygiene factors**: These won’t encourage employees to work harder but they will cause them to become unmotivated if they are not present.

You can think about the common motivators – sense of achievement, responsibility, security, salary, policies et all.

They all fall under one or the other

All this is good to know, but why should it matter?

Because this applies equally to our lives.

The conclusion he drew is that job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction are not opposites.

Remedying the causes of dissatisfaction will not create satisfaction

Once the hygiene factors are met, what keeps people motivated is catering to people’s deep-seated need for growth and achievement –

Interesting work, learning opportunities or increasing responsibility.

What else do you think keeps people motivated?

It’s Better To Be Prolific Than Perfect

In the book, Art & Fear, David Bayles and Ted Orland shared the following story:

“The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups.

All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.

His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “

Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”.

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.

It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay”

Have there been ideas you are waiting to act upon for either fear of being judged or waiting for perfection?

Should I resign this job? Should I move to a new city? Is this the stream I want to pursue?  
How can we take better decisions?

Regardless of whether you are a student or a professional, the quality of the decisions you make ultimately determines the quality of your life.

The 4 villains of decision making are –  
#1Narrow framing \[this/that decisions\],  
#2Confirmation Bias \[looking to confirm what we already believe in\]  
#3ShortTermEmotionalRationalization  
#4Overconfidence

Being Decisive – The WRAP framework for better and bolder decisions

To overcome this, Chip and Dan Heath propose the WRAP framework  
W -Widen your options  
R – Reality-test your assumptions  
A – Attain distance before deciding  
P – Prepare to be wrong

Are you above average? Is your child an A student?

Is your employee an introvert or an extrovert?

Every day we are measured against the yardstick of averages, judged according to how closely we come to it or how far we deviate from it.

The assumption that metrics comparing us to an average—like GPAs, personality test results, and performance review ratings—reveal something meaningful about our potential is so ingrained in our consciousness that we don’t even question it.

That assumption, says Harvard’s Todd Rose, is spectacularly—and scientifically—wrong

The average-size-fits-all model ignores our differences and fails at recognizing talent.

In the early 1940s, gynecologists made an alabaster model of a typical young female by averaging the proportions of thousands of women.

The statue, named Norma, was hailed as a physical ideal.

Yet when a newspaper ran a contest fewer than 40 applicants even came close.

He recommends the three principles of individuality.

**#1The** Jaggedness principle (talent is always jagged)

**#2The** Context principle (each person has a unique set of behavioral “if-then signatures”- more meaningful than any overarching characterization)

**#3The** Pathways principle (diverse approaches can achieve equivalent results)

Rating – 4.5/5

Book – [A Promised Land, Barack Obama](https://www.amazon.in/Promised-Land-Barack-Obama/dp/0241491517)

Today we are going to talk about one of the most highly anticipated books of 2020.  
The presidential memoir – A Promised Land – Barack Obama

I love this genre – biographies/autobiographies

It is almost like taking a peek into the day to day lives of people we admire from afar

And we come back with the feeling of being acquainted to the stranger we have never met  
Or might never meet.

First off – the book is massive

A whopping 29 hours \[19 hours at 1.5X speed\]  
Yet – I didn’t want this to end. Especially because it was read in Obama’s deep voice that is reassuring.

Obama takes us on a journey through his childhood to his political infancy, through grassroots activism and his explosive growth to the highest office in America.

It has details – a lot of it, both personal and political. More of the latter than the former though.

It covers his compelling journey of turning his political aspirations into reality – amidst personal and political battles that seemed insurmountable

It was mesmerizing to understand the underlying diplomacy and mind- games that entails moving to the highest office

Reflecting on his presidency, he delves into landmark moments that marked his first term of presidency – It’s now an account of American history, a record of his decisions and time in office

Taking over the presidency at a tumultuous time – with the fall of Lehman brothers and with the economy in turmoil  
To passing the controversial Affordable care act  
Tackling international issues whilst reflecting on the role and responsibility that US plays in mediating across countries beyond its borders – from the war torn middle-east, to the delicate balance of power across countries that need to be maintained to bills on climate change

I don’t think I can do justice to the detail by covering this in a few mins.

Three key themes that stood out to me though

1. > ”’Whatever you do won’t be enough,’ I heard their voices say.‘Try anyway.’”  
Politics much like for anyone in power is a game – only the ones who know how to play right win. There are so many instances he calls out where even wanting to do the right thing entails juggling between multiple forces – of negotiation and power plays.  
It reminded me of my naivete I had and maybe still have that ‘if I explain my points cogently and do my work right, things will happen the way I intended it to be’
2. **Emotions drive people**  
And in a trope that is universal specially in people we elect. People vote for stories – Not rational decisions or a cost benefit analysis. And in the absence of rationality or to mask it – hot button topics are used universally for diverting attention. It is always a story of us vs them. Defined by race, gender, nationality or religion That is the common denominator that can be always relied upon to drive divisiveness. And the critical role media plays in shaping narratives. And the only thing that can hold us through is awareness, learning and education.
3. **The backstory. There is always a backstory.** The international diplomacy fascinated me. We are made privy to his thoughts as he takes critical decisions – of sending young soldiers knowing many won’t return. I have always wondered the thoughts of leaders who meet and pose for smiling photographs – something I loved reading about.

He talks about people, puts us in places and situations we have only read the headlines for. From the situation room where he planned and waited in baited breath for the fall of Osama Bin Laden, to places around the world – from Moscow to Beijing.  
Across Sarah Palin to Vladamir Putin, Manmohan Singh to Gen Stanley MacChrystal  
And finally, though lesser than what I anticipated it would be – glimpses of his life with Michelle and the girls. Of losing out of being a ‘unknown person’ and a ‘normal life’ on the street forever.

After being surprised that this book covered only his first term of presidency I realized late that there is apparently an second volume that is due. One I can’t wait to get my hands on.

Such a beautifully written book – while I do not have enough context of the country to comment about the decisions taken or his leadership, it is a powerful narrative of what an individual can achieve.

I will end this with my favorite quote – one I have on a post-it at my desk

> “Enthusiasm makes up for a host of deficiencies.”

So what?

I wish people who work with data ask that question more often.

Many a time, data scientists focus on first order thinking i.e. we need to build A, B and C.

What drives business value though is second order thinking – thinking through how that outcome will help drive tangible business value.

#1 Do you start with the right question?

#2 Are you talking to the business experts to ensure you are looking at data that matters?

#3 Are you asking questions that breaks cognitive dissonance – or looking at data to help you reveal what you think it should be?

#4 And most importantly, are you telling the right story with data

If your end user has to work hard to understand numbers, it isn’t good enough.

More than anything else, I think data scientists who want to differentiate themselves would benefit from a design thinking approach.

Do you start with the user? What are the data fails you have come across?

“What is it that decides what organs shall suffer from cancer?”

Siddhartha Mukherjee, the renowned oncologist, talks about the need to re-evaluate how we treat diseases  
(I have a huge nerd crush on the guy!)

Existing model of disease treatment : “Have disease, target it, kill disease”

The dominance of this model is due to the ‘antibiotic introduction’

In this, the chemical would course through the body, lock into the target and turn it off.

So seductive was the idea that we have tried to replicate the model over and over.

It has worked but only partly.

If we take the universe of all chemical reactions in the body (\~1M), the fraction of these reactions that can be targeted by pharma remains minuscule at 250.

250

The rest is ‘chemical darkness’.

Only 0.025% of the reactions are thus targeted by this lock-and-key mechanism.

It raises fascinating questions about the future –

#1 Could the medicine be a cell and not a pill  
#2 Could it be an organ grown outside of the body  
#3 Could these be stored? Or can it be grown separately for each person?  
#4 Could medicine be an environment? Could we patent this?

Thoughts?

There are 5 fundamental conversations with your boss that is central to your ramp up plan. Most people take a reactive approach to this and thus fail.

I personally would recommend #4 for everyone

#1 The Situational Diagnosis conversation :  
\* Seek to understand how you new boss looks at the portfolio that you have inherited -is it a Startup, Turnaround, Accelerated growth, Realignment or a Sustaining success situation.

#2 The Expectations conversations  
\* Understand and negotiate what does your new boss need you to do in the short-term and in the medium term  
\* What constitutes acceptance and how will your performance be measured and when

#3 The Resources Conversation  
\* This is a conversation for negotiation of critical resources you need to be successful  
\* This need not be limited to funding personnel

#4 The Style conversation  
\* Align on how to communicate on an ongoing basis  
\* Communication that he/she prefers  
\* How often what kinds of decisions does he/she want to be consulted and when you make the call on your own

#5 The Personal Development conversation  
\* A few months into the new role one can begin to discuss areas of strength and development

In 2020, I started on this journey to learn to tell better stories.  
  
From one of the best design and innovation organizations – [IDEO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ideo/)  
  
Across these weeks, we have had the opportunity to work with fabulous coaches and a cohort of highly creative people from around the world  
  
Identifying the story that I want to tell, to change the world  
– one sticky note at a time.  
  
From developing a blueprint into storytelling prototypes and finally bringing the story to life  
  
I realized how difficult it is to pare down the numbers and make it personal and emotional.  
  
How it takes multiple iterations to simplify – and then some more.  
  
To finally come up with a narrative \[which is for another post\]  
  
It still is a journey – and there are iterations to go.  
  
But I would definitely approach communicating for impact differently.  
  
Especially in storytelling with numbers.  
  
Here to the irresistible power of storytelling as a strategic business asset

You have a vision for a better future and you need others on board.  
  
Talking about change is easy, making it real is harder. So, where do you get started?  
  
That is the question that I intended to get help answering in the latest IDEO course I wrapped up on ‘Designing for Change’  
  
Here are my key take-aways  
  
#1 There are two ways to realize a change : A mandate \[top-down\] and a movement \[bottom-up\]. And movements’ are empowering.  
  
#2 No matter where you sit within your organization, you have the ability to make change happen – Big changes start small and they start with people.  
  
#3 How can one frame the change in a way that invites participation and motivates buy-in.  
  
#4 The Atlas complex : Any time I worked on leading change, I have \[I realize now\] unintentionally, carried the weight of the change on my shoulder. It is hugely liberating to understand that we can harness the collective energy to take action and not have to suffer from the Atlas complex.  
  
#5 Most importantly – the fact that change is a journey. One that can frustrating. But celebrate the small wins and let it add momentum 🙂

#PODSHORTSChallenge

Genre – Fiction/Fantasy

Book 2/52, 2021

Rating – 3.7/5

Book – [The Midnight Library](https://www.amazon.in/Midnight-Library-Novel-Matt-Haig/dp/0525559477), Matt Haig

Have you ever mourned other lives you could have lived?

Pursued other subjects or picked a career path very different from the one you are on?

When I was growing up, my childhood ambition was to become a doctor – a neurosurgeon at that.

I was fascinated by what I thought they did.

The reason I didn’t end up as one was a culmination of factors – including the fact that my parents’ didn’t trust in my marriage prospects if I did become one.

That is the premise this book seeks – The Midnight Library by Matt Haig

what if you could live all the other lives you wanted to live?

The protagonist Nora Seed wants to die.

The young women’s life is in shambles – one she thinks is because of all the terrible choices she has made.

She has lost her job, her cat, her brother and her best friend.

She seems to be on the verge of a bleak future she can’t seem to getting better.

So she decides to end it all

And the world goes black.

But she wakes up – not in heaven or hell but a place in between

The midnight library – the place between life and death.

Interestingly with her school librarian – Mrs Elm in it.

She proclaims – 

> “Every life contains many millions of decisions – Some big, some small.   
> But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations. These books are portals to all the lives you could be living”

And so she does – exploring through each book every regret or possibility. What if she had actually married the fiance – the marriage she called off 2 days ahead of the event.

Or stuck with the music band

Or moved to Australia with her best friend

Or listened to her dad and followed his path to her career

What if?

That is a question I have asked myself often.

And that is the question the midnight library seeks to help with.

Nora struggles across these multiple lives she flits through even as she tries to reconcile her imagination to the potential reality

> “The only way to learn is to live”, Mrs Elm says sagely.

We think we want certain things and that life will become easier once we get there. We ignore the journey with eye only on the goal post.

Is the reward of life in the living itself.

Nora lives hundreds of lives – seeking out a life – flitting across each without really knowing what she wants.

Which life will she choose?

If you have infinite possibilities and choices – how do you choose?

Or better still, does the choice matter?

“It is easy to mourn the lives we aren’t living. Easy to wish we’d developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we’d worked harder, loved better or been more popular…. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out.

> But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself.  
> It’s the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people’s worst enemy.

We can’t tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. …we have to focus on.”

While I once aspired to become a doctor – looking back I think it is one of those fascinations that is better in my imagination than in reality.

I still am besotted by science and learning about the brain. So while I have more physicians on my Linkedin connections than I can logically explain, the point is that, it is easy to glorify what we do not have.

“If you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail.

> Aim to be you. Aim to look and act and think like you. Aim to be the truest version of you”

The rise of the No Code / Low Code market in 2021

And what does this imply to us?

Low/no-code development platforms “expedite the creation of new applications with minimal coding requirements and offer tools for nonprogrammers.

How? By relieving them of the need to write code line by line.

This also puts some form of abstracted development tools in the hands of non-technical users.

Some industry experts are still a tad skeptical – “Putting low-code platforms in the hands of everyone will create problems with governance.” 

This also reflects in the buzz around this space in start-ups – almost like a Deja-vu of the ‘chatbot’ market a few years ago

Notwithstanding the mixed views – Forrester expects the market for low-code development platforms to increase to $21.2 billion by 2022, up from $1.7 billion in 2017, a CAGR of 41%

What does this imply?

Gartner predicts “that low-code application platforms will account for 65 percent of all app development by 2024.”

With so much remote work – Is the time is right for low-code and no-code software development?

> “If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them.” – Orwell

In a remote-first world, writing well is but an essential skill.

If I were to pick skills for ‘deliberate practice’, learning to communicate well would top the list

Writing clearly and concisely means choosing your words deliberately – to get your point across to the audience.

Here is George Orwell’s \[yes, 1984 \] Six rules for writing clearly

**#Rule1**. “Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.” – skip the cliched phrases

**#Rule2**. “Never use a long word where a short one will do.”

\[“due to the fact that” = Because\]

**#Rule3**. “If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.”

**#Rule4**. “Never use the passive where you can use the active.”

\[I made a mistake. vs Mistakes were made\]

**#Rule5.** “Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.”

**#Rule6**. “Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.”

Those who care about clarity of thought and responsible use of rhetoric would do well to consult or re-read, [Orwell’s essay ](https://lhsblogs.typepad.com/files/george-orwell-on-writing.pdf)

I have since focused on avoiding the annoying buzzwords – i.e. – synergy, paradigm shift, disruption..

Which of the rules do you find most effective?

The premise of the novel is the first of its kind – that in real world, we make business decisions not in a spreadsheet but at dinner tables with our own unique and flawed perspectives of the world

> “This book says things that haven’t been said before, and they make sense’

says the back cover. Can’t agree more

It that lays the fundamentals required for investing without delving into jargons. Precise and lucid with a lot of understanding of the psychology of an individual average human looking at building a solid financial future

The book I am talking about is The Psychology of Money – we’ll talk about 7 timeless lesson on wealth, greed and happiness.

With its understated brilliance that shines across the 19 stories exploring strange ways in which we think and handle money, the author Morgan Housel teaches us much more than money in this short book.

This is my favorite anecdote from the book –

Ronald Read’s wiki entry reads that ‘he was a American philanthropist, investor, janitor and gas station attendant. He fixed cars for 25 years and swept floors at JC Penny for 17 years. When he died in 2014 at the age of 92, he left behind a inheritance of 8 million USD.

Where did it all come from? There was no lottery – he just saved what little he could and invested it in blue chip stocks and then he waited.

For decades — until the tiny savings compounded to the 8 million!

> “A genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind”

Here are 7 of my favorite stories from across the book –

#### No One’s crazy 

Everyone has an unique experience by which they look at the world. People do not make investments based on goals alone but is heavily anchored by their experiences – if you grew up when inflation was high, you tend to invest lesser in bonds.

My parents, both of whom worked government jobs, ensured we saved more than 70% of their incomes towards our future – and that is what I do even if I can afford to spend more.

#### The role of Luck and Risk – in investing and in life

“What do you know about investing that we can’t know?”, a economics Nobel prize winner was asked. “The exact role of luck in successful outcomes”

Since it is hard to quantify luck and rude to suggest that it played a role in people’s success, the default is to ignore the role it plays

We praise Mark Zuckerberg as a genius for turning down Yahoo’s 2006 $1B offer and at the same time criticize Yahoo for turning down the buy-out offer from Microsoft.

Don’t we judge our decisions by their outcomes?

So how do you identify what is skill and what is luck and what is risk?

* Realize that not all success is due to hard work and not all poverty is due to laziness, he says.
* Focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns. Instead of emulating Warren buffet’s investment strategy, realize that people who have control of their time are happier

#### Never Enough

I remember my grandmother telling me the story of this king who kept invading kingdoms because ‘it was never enough’.

“There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need”. The hardest financial skill is to get the goalpost to stop moving

#### Compounding

$81.5 B of Warren Buffet’s $84.5B net worth came after his 65 birthday. We underestimate the power of compounding. None of the 2000 books on Buffets strategies talk about how the guy has been ‘investing consistently for 3/4th of a century”

#### Getting wealthy vs staying wealthy

Good investing is not necessarily about making good decisions. Its also about consistently not screwing up.

There are a million ways to get wealthy – but there is only one to stay wealthy.

A combination of frugality and paranoia – one we don’t pay attention to much

#### Tails you win – you can be wrong half the time and still win.

Tails drive everything. 2.5% of investment by VCs make 10X to 20X – it also happens across investing. 

> “Your success as an investor will be determined by how you respond to punctuated moments of terror and not the years spent in cruise control”

#### Freedom

Controlling your time is the highest form of freedom. Being able to wake up and say ‘I can do whatever I want today’.

People think become wealthier makes them happier – but the common denominator of happiness is that people want to control our lives.

> The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money paid

I loved it so much that I gifted it to everyone on my team. I think it’s a copy every single person should own. Such a short and enjoyable read!

What skills differentiates leaders who grow into executives vs those who don’t ?

Our 40-to-50-year career can be divided into segments of 12 to 15 years, or “acts”  
  
[#ActI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=acti&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6754722343534370816) – The Set-up where one transitions from an IC to a Leader  
[#ActII](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=actii&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6754722343534370816) – The transition from a leader to an executive.  
[#ActIII](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=actiii&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6754722343534370816) – Where you start your second career, hopefully unconstrained by previous financial and personal needs.  
  
It’s a huge accomplishment to become a leader in a company and certainly nothing to minimize. But only a small percentage, perhaps as few as 20%, continue to scale from a leader to an executive in Act 2.  
  
Why? When is good enough not enough?  
  
Do we need different skills in Act II from what led to your success in Act I?  
  
These are the questions [Nikhyl Singhal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAATt9cB-kJGIgH0rlS7J9pNtNHbYywcxmc) raises and answers in his newsletter – The Skip. I really enjoy reading them

Which of these flight announcements may distress you more –  
“BA786 Frankfurt – Delayed”  
OR  
“BA786 Frankfurt – Delayed 70 minutes”  
  
The second message is a bit of a pain but you are in control of the situation.  
  
You can get on with planning your day around this  
  
Vs. the first message which is a mental torture – you know it is bad news but there is uncertainty around it  
  
Delayed for 10 mins or 90?  
Should I stay put or grab a meal?  
  
The loss of control can create more unhappiness than the actual delay.  
  
Yet if you research airline passengers, very few would actually tell you that the uncertainty is the issue  
  
Very rarely do people actually tell you why they want the things they do  
  
Why is Red Bull so popular – even though everyone hates the taste? Why do countdown boards on platforms take away the pain of train delays? And why do we prefer stripy toothpaste?

We think we are rational creatures. Economics and business rely on the assumption that we make logical decisions based on evidence.  
  
But we aren’t, and we don’t.  
  
The big problems we face every day, whether as an individual or in society, could very well be solved at times by letting go of logic and embracing the irrational

**Follow the process, build the habit**

Let me tell you a story – a friend and I wanted to hold each other accountable to something we had been putting off for a while.

We decided to block each work day at 7AM to work on our respective activities for a month.

I wrote blog articles each day – and she painted each day. We spoke about our progress to each other every weekend.

Did I become an author or she an artist – Not really.

Did we get good at what we were trying – absolutely.

Routines help build habits.

“In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.”

The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead” – James Clear

So here are 7 steps to a better you

**Step 1** – Avoid context switching – use chunking. Each time you answer the mail or take the meeting, your attention moves away from the task at hand. For you to effectively work, design your calendar into chunks of similar activities. Check out the _Chunk-the-day Template in the tracker_

**Step 2 – Allocate time for DeepWork & DawnWall Goals.**

Much has been research about being the the state of ‘flow’ to be your productive best. Find a couple of hours on the calendar for you to do the most ‘high-value’ work for the day. Example – this is mostly my highest ROI effort required at work.

Also allocate a slot for the dawn wall goals defined earlier – ex, writing each day for 30 mins.

**Step 3 – Morning and Night Routines**

You maybe an early riser or not. What I have noticed though is that when I follow my morning routine, I usually have accomplished more in the first half than some people do all week. Do what makes you happy. Find time in the day where you can add these activities. Check out the _Morning & Evening Routine Template_

**Step 4 – Gratitude Journal**

I started this when I got the 5 minute journal. Now I do a ‘stream of consciousness’/’journal prompts’ and a gratitude each day. All of which takes 15 mins. Check out the _Journaling template_

**Step 5**– Work in Pomodoros’ to stay in ‘the flow’. Check out Kanbanflow.com for the pomodoro timer that can be used against set systems

**Step 6** – Make it harder to be interrupted

Disable ALL notifications on your phone and laptop – you decide when to be interrupted, not the other way around.

**Step 7** – Use Seinfeld’s Red X strategy to not break the chain.

Check out the _Red X – Don’t Break the chain template_

“For each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. After a few days you’ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job is to not break the chain.”

The free pdf below provides all the templates mentioned above + a Food Log!

Here is to Happy and Productive days!

Switched jobs or roles? – Here are 5 steps to accelerating learning in your new role

Many leaders come in with ‘the solution’ even before understanding new environment

This is not efficient and can back-fire

Here are 5 questions to ask your direct reports when you start with your new role

This list is from this brilliant book that is called the ‘On-boarding bible’ – The First 90 days, Michael Watkins

> _“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here”_ said Alice.  
> _“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to”_, said the Cat.  
> _“I don’t much care where”_, said Alice.  
> _“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go”_, said the Cat.

This is one of my all-time favorite quotes. It applies equally to business and life.

If you don’t know where you are going, any road can take you there.

One thing that drives me is how can I be better – and for me to do that, I need to figure out how to hack into improving where I focus my energy.

I have tried various things in the past to plan my annual goals – from plain old books, Bullet journals, gilded diaries to digital tools like ToDoIst or Evernote.

Through trial and error, I figured out what keeps me away from getting to them. 

These past few days I looked at all my goals that I had failed on accomplishing this year and listed out reasons why. 

They mostly fall under these 5 buckets –

1. I don’t want it badly enough or there is no strong ‘why’ behind my goals.
2. I am overwhelmed by the day-to-day – I don’t plan for failure
3. It seems like there is more for me to do than what I can handle – I don’t have a mental model to prioritize my decisions
4. I have a goal post but the path is fuzzy – I don’t have a system to get to the end of the journey
5. I, like other humans, have limited will power – I am not leveraging routines and building habits.

So I did the next best thing I could instead of repeating the same mistakes in 2021\. 

I built a planner to help address these with pin-pointed solutions.

I have been quite inspired by the design thinking and hands-on prototyping philosophy from my IDEO workshops, so I have added 

* 5 activities that you can do in under 1 hour that will help you uncover your goals, motives and a process to get things done.
* 5 templates that you can print out to help you with designing your  
best year yet!

The question that I have seen people struggle with the most is ‘How do you manage to find time’. We underestimate how persistence and grit always beats talent. Or how the tiniest of changes can result in completely different paths.

Grab a pen and a hot beverage. Find some solitude and I hope this helps you as much as I hope it did I.

So go ahead and download this free “Find your Dawnwall planner”. You don’t need to sign-up, provide your email, it is completely free and will always be. 

Ensure to pay it forward and share it with someone else you think might benefit from this!

P.S – please share your feedback so that I can maybe do a better job in the next version 🙂

“Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.”

Or – The Red Queen Effect.

One of my all-time favorite book is Lewis Carrol’s – Through the Looking Glass

The Red Queen Effect is based on the character in the book who schools Alice when she finds herself running faster and faster but staying in the same place.

“It refers to the increased pressure to adapt faster just to survive, is driven by an increase in the evolutionary pace of rival technology solutions”

What does this mean for us?

Rather than run harder, the article recommends it would be nice to run smarter.

Here are three of the ways we can try to avoid the Red Queen.

**#1** Invest in learning and adding real-world value to people.

This is not a popular path as it’s incredibly expensive in time and money. Standing still, however, is more expensive.

If we fail to keep getting better, we won’t exist.

**#2** Spend our limited mental resources working on things that won’t change next week – i.e mental models which explain how the world works. Ex – First principles or playing with Integrity

**#3** Acknowledge ‘how the world works and not how we want it to work’

Check out the examples of the red queen effect in medicine, evolution and business in the link in comments.

This is the compendium of all the books I usually add to my TBR list in my journal.

I plan to do this documenting online this year to help folks pick books for the #52in52bookclub challenge.

Stay tuned for this.

A few points to note before we get to the list –

1. This is an ever evolving list of books
2. Not all of these may get read – and that is okay.
3. If you have a recommendation – please drop a comment with the title, rating and why you would recommend it to a friend

Genre – Non-Fiction, Management, SaaS, Future of Work, Tech

Book 50/52

Rating – 3.5/5

Book – [Subscribed: Why the Subscription Model Will Be Your Company’s Future](https://www.amazon.in/Subscribed-Subscription-Model-Companys-Future%5Fand/dp/0241363667/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dchild=1&keywords=subscribed&qid=1608097621&sr=8-1)

**Netflix, Spotify, and Salesforce** 

What are the common threads among these three groups of companies?

> _They are all succeeding because they recognized that we now live in a digital world, and in this new world, customers are different._ 

Customers he says want a new way to engage with business. Over the last 10 decade, the world he says is shifting from products to services.

Subscription companies are growing nine times faster than the S&P 500.

These business models all designed to keep customers consistently engaged in long-term relationships—think Netflix, Amazon Prime, Uber, Spotify, Salesforce, Zendesk, Box.

The book almost can be thought of as two parts – the first that talks about the fascinating facts about the subscription economy and the latter, steps one could take to get there

Here are 5 questions we will try answer in this video

**\[1\]What do customers today want in the new digital economy?**

Customers want outcomes not ownership. 

He talks about how at the heart of the subscription economy is the idea that customers are happier subscribing to outcomes they want, when they want them, rather than purchasing a product with the burden of ownership.

**\[2\] Can any company move from a product to a relationship mindset?**

Move away from the product economy to a relationship based one – Subscription experiences built around needs are better than static offerings. Focus is on finding values to deliver on-going value to customers

* Caterpillar uses subscriptions to help solve problems – it’s not about how many tractors you can rent, but how much dirt you need to move.
* Fender evolves from selling guitars one at a time to creating lifelong musicians by teaching beginners to play, and keeping them inspired for life.
* Today’s consumers prefer the advantages of access over the hassles of maintenance, from transportation (Uber, Surf Air), to clothing (Stitch Fix, Eleven James), to razor blades and makeup (Dollar Shave Club, Birchbox).

**\[3\] How does this new model impact the revenues?**

Subscription models create a predictable recurring revenue stream

For this we need to understand ‘swallowing the fish’ – the transition period in moving from a traditional to a SaaS model. This is when the revenue curve temporarily dips below the operating expense curve before climbing back upward again. The fish is what happens when a traditional company shifts it revenue mix from an asset purchase model to a subscription model. The company experiences a string of quarters where topline revenue shrinks without the large upfront payment.

Ex – when SFDC reports its annual revenue figures and notes that its deferred revenue figures are 60% of that number that means it gets to start next year with more than half its revenue target in the bank. Wall street appropriately might give them much higher multiples than it would a company without that second figure.

**\[4\] How have the traditional companies reinvented themselves to be SaaS first? The Adobe case study**

Adobe transitions from selling enterprise software licenses to offering cloud-based solutions for a flat monthly fee, and quadruples its valuation. In the perpetual model, there were a number of red flags, Adobe was driving revenue growth by increasing selling price – product updates were delivered only once in 18 months but the customers’ requirements were more frequent. When they switched over to the SaaS suite, they gave customers some time – giving themselves a year of parallel sales models. These were followed by sustained evangelization of the new model, walking their customers through the reasons and explaining benefits -including f2f meetings with 50K customers. In 3 years Adobe creative cloud went from no subscription revenue to 100% subscription model. It inspired MSFT, Intuit, Autodesk and PTC. It has 5B USD in ARR from practically none in 2012.

Over 70% of its revenue is recurring!

**\[5\] Why does SaaS allow companies not to cater to the lowest common denominator. The reason we have such quality media content – movies, music and shows and how is it ties to the new business model?**

Netflix that started streaming movies from 2007, went from 0 to 100 million streaming subscribers in 10 years. This is a new golden age of media – there is so much more music, movies and shows to discover. Freed from a block-buster mindset \[which is akin to preparing and releasing a big product\], new streaming services do not have to worry about streaming and chasing l**owest common denominator budget** and can afford to take on edgier projects. Netflix apparently spends 8B USD/year on original content. So how does Netflix justify spending on a TV show or movie that doesn’t sell – regardless of whether the show is successful or not, investing in sharp new content allows Netflix to

a\] Attract new subscribers and

b\] Extend the lifetime of current subscribers. Together they are increasing overall value of the portfolio

P.S : Can academics be subscribed?

Eventually, yes. It might.

McKinsey says SaaS has become the default software delivery model.

The ‘next normal’ established by COVID will accelerate the footprint of SaaS, given the growth of remote working, the rapid deployment of digital solutions and lower-up front costs.

What do you think makes a successful investment strategy?

Here is the story of Sue, Jim and Tom.

Sue invests $1 every month into the US stock market each month. No matter a recession or inflation. She just continues to invest from 1900 to 2019.

Jim invests $1 in stocks when the economy is not in recession and saves monthly dollars in cash and invests back when the recession ends.

Tom invests $1 in stocks when there is no recession, sells 6 months after the recession begins, and invests back in 6 months after the recession ends.

How much money do you think these three end up the period?

Sue – $435,551

Jim – $257,386

Tom – $234,476

A lot of things in investing, or business work based on long-tails

The farthest ends of a distribution of the outcomes have tremendous influence.

Just over 300/1428 months were in recession.

By keeping her cool during the 22% of time, Sue ends up with 3/4th more money than the other two.

A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy.

This is from this brilliant book – [The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.in/Psychology-Money-Morgan-Housel/dp/9390166268/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=1JUCPQ9MZZHKJ&dchild=1&keywords=the+psychology+of+money&qid=1608010202&sprefix=the+ps%2Caps%2C299&sr=8-1)

It argues that doing well with money isn’t necessarily about what you know.

It’s about how you behave. And that is hard to teach 🙂

Book 51/52

Rating – 4/5

Book – [The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse](https://www.amazon.in/Boy-Mole-Fox-Horse/dp/0062976583)

This is a book I bought for my 5 year old

As I read this out to her, I paused multiple times as tears welled up in my eyes.

It is so precious and timeless that it is relevant to pretty much anyone across ages.

With beautiful illustrations, charming handwriting and sentences that convey life’s truth in simple, albeit powerful ways, it’s hard not to fall in love with this book.

It introduces us to the precocious boy – Charlie and his 3 unlikely friends – the mole, the horse and the fox on the journey uncovering life’s lessons

It’s about friendship and kindness, of love and bravery, of hardships and homecoming and about doing the right thing.

It is a book that I wished would go on post the 20 mins it took for me to finish reading it.

So much so that I listened to the audible version of it – which is equally heartwarming – with all the background music.

It could seem like a collection of feel-good and inspirational quotes – but in the uncertain times we live in, we could all do with some goodness and hope.

I can’t do the review without reading out some of these gorgeous lines

> “What do you want to be when you grow up”  
>  
> “Kind”

Do yourself a favor and pick this up for your child, your mom or yourself this festive season

It feels like a warm cup of cocoa on a rainy day. And a book that reminds us of the good left in humanity – even in trying times.

A few years ago a company launched an intelligent recommendation system for its customer service agents to suggest solutions to customer problems.

The project was viewed as a high-profile cost-saver for the company.

It took nine months to figure out that the agents weren’t using it,…

And it took another six months to figure out why.

The recommendations the system was offering weren’t relevant, but the problem wasn’t in the machine learning algorithms.

Instead, the company had relied on training data based on technical descriptions of customer problems rather than how customers would describe them in their own words

According to a recent IDC survey, only about 30% of companies reported a 90% success rate for AI projects.

A key determinant of success of ML projects is whether data scientists work with stakeholders and SMEs to incorporate business context.

Keen on becoming a data scientist?

One of the key skills you can pick up is critical thinking.

* Objectively analyze questions, hypotheses, and results
* Understand what resources are critical to solve a problem
* Look at problems from differing views and perspectives
* Align on what an actionable outcome and success looks like to the end user

Book Recommendation of the Week : No Rules Rules

Shortlisted for the 2020 Financial Times & McKinsey Business Book of the Year

Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings talks about the unorthodox culture behind one of the world’s most innovative, imaginative, and successful companies.

Here are my top three take-aways –

1. HIGH PERFORMANCE + SELFLESS CANDOR = EXTREMELY HIGH PERFORMANCE – In other words, build talent density, avoid micromanaging and encourage open feedback. Give Freedom, Get Responsibility.
2. 5-A feedback approach – Aim to assist, Actionable, Appreciate, Accept/Decline, Adapt. Say what you really think with good intent. Do not say anything behind a person’s back that you wouldn’t be comfortable sharing with him/her.
3. Are you operating in the ‘creative/knowledge’ economy or a industrial/manufacturing one?  
When a mistake will lead to a disaster, rules and process is essential to have.  
But for those operating in the creative economy – organizations thrive on creativity, agility, freedom and sense of ownership.  
Yet many organizations’ continue to follow processes that dominated the industrial era.

How do you enable your teams to bond and share knowledge in a remote first set-up?

One can be in back-to-back calls and yet not feel connected – much like being in a room full of people but feeling lonely.

I think this is a very real problem that leaders need to address.

Here are few ideas that we have tried/trying –

**1) 15 Min Dailies**

As a global team, we are used working in a weekly sprint model with a daily stand-up – gives the team visibility to larger goals & share learnings with each other!

**2) ML Read/Discuss sessions** We have such a passionate set of folks who love learning – folks share papers, concepts and discuss latest in the space

**3) ‘Talk-about-your-Interest’ sessions** 

We have topics ranging from Dockers, Kubernetes, AI ethics, mental models to Llama’s!

**4) Brain Hack Sessions**

Have a problem? Brainstorm to solve it together

**5) Fun-day Monday** 

Start the week on a great note- we do kahoot quizzes on sports, movies and even appreciate-someone-day

Our quarterly hackathons and switching our water cooler conversations to a slack channel also helps!

Do you have a team building/bonding idea to share?

What do you think are the ingredients for Happiness?  
  
Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychology professor and a popular author on the topic of Happiness summarized the common elements we usually consider on what it takes to be happy  
  
– A comfortable income  
– Robust health  
– A supportive marriage and  
– A lack of tragedy or trauma  
  
She noted however that the general conclusion from these are correlated with happiness less strongly than we actually think  
  
By several estimates all of these variables put together account for no more than 8-15% of the variance in happiness  
  
What then accounts for most of the variance in happiness?  
  
How we do comparatively  
  
We price our own happiness relative to others  
  
A lot of how we feel about ourselves comes from how we think about it in relation to others.  
  
By shifting what it is that makes us feel good about ourselves, we can move towards a more compassionate view of others  
  
Give others credit when it is due  
Admit when our decisions could have been better  
Acknowledging that almost nothing is black and white  
  
TL-DR – Find better ways to feel good about oneself than to schadenfreude

Rating – 4/5

Book – [A World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should Respond](https://www.amazon.in/World-Without-Work-Daniel-Susskind/dp/0241321093/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=3PYL9YA67ARUP&dchild=1&keywords=a+world+without+work&qid=1604897488&sprefix=A+world+w%2Caps%2C295&sr=8-1) 

\[Shortlisted FT/McKinsey business book of the year\]

Growing up, our parents and teachers explained that if we kept our heads down and tried hard at school or whatever else we chose to do, then a future of stable paid work will be waiting for us. As we got older, we can expect to be paid more and when we were old we can stop working and draw on the fruits of our labors.

Life was all about work – Preparing for it, doing it, retiring from it.

And that seemed ok

Is the world without work inevitable with the accelerating technology progress?

Is it a good thing?

How do we handle an era with no work for humans?

1. The problem of inequality or working out how to share the economic prosperity with everyone in society
2. The problem of political power – of determining who gets to control the tech responsible for the prosperity and on what terms?
3. The problem of meaning. Of figuring out how to use this prosperity not just to live with less work but to live well

Given the depth and my interest in the topic, I am doing this as a series of 7 short videos, discussing key concepts from the book along with a guest through this week.

Stay tuned!

Part 1 : Understanding Tech Unemployment and what it implies to our future

Part 2 – World Without Work

Can automation not always be a bad thing?  
Learn about the three ways in which automation may be helping us in the long term

Part 3 – Difference between Frictional vs Structural Unemployment

Did you know of the Greek story behind the word Tantalizing and how that is related to frictional unemployment?

Part 4 – What is the meaning to our lives in a world without work in our future?

How do we use this prosperity tech brings in not just to live with less work but to also live well?

Around 5 weeks ago, I started on this journey to learn to tell better stories.

From one of the best design and innovation organizations – IDEO

Across these weeks, we have had the opportunity to work with fabulous coaches and a cohort of highly creative people from around the world

Identifying the story that I want to tell, to change the world  
– one sticky note at a time.

From developing a blueprint into storytelling prototypes and finally bringing the story to life

I realized how difficult it is to pare down the numbers and make it personal and emotional.

How it takes multiple iterations to simplify – and then some more.

To finally come up with a narrative \[which is for another post\]

It still is a journey – and there are iterations to go.

But I would definitely approach communicating for impact differently.

Especially in storytelling with numbers.

Here to to all the irresistible power of storytelling as a strategic business asset

The parable of horse shit

In 1800s, cities like NY relied on thousands of horses to heave carts, cabins et all through the streets.

The horse drawn double decker buses were quite popular

With the horses came manure – and lots of it.

A healthy horse produced manure equivalent to a 2 year old child.

Each day.

People extrapolated this to a manure filled future.

A London news commentator predicted that by mid 20th century, streets would be buried under 9 ft of the stuff.

In the end policy makers didn’t need have worried.

By 1912, Henry Ford’s Model T brought in more cars than horses on NY streets

And the manure crises was over.

The parable of horse-shit has been told many times.

As a tale of tech triumph

Wassily Leontief, the economist who won the Nobel in 1973, used the same events though to draw a different conclusion.

In early 1980s, Leontific made the infamous claim –

“What technological progress had done to horses, it would do to human beings as well”

Drive us out of work.

Thus begins the book by Daniel Susskind – A World Without Work.

Thankfully, it takes a more realistic outlook that tech could bring in to the future

One that I believe in.

Rating – 3/5

Book – [I Hear You: The Surprisingly Simple Skill Behind Extraordinary Relationships](https://www.amazon.in/Hear-You-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Relationships-ebook/dp/B071K4MWMK)

The One Skill that can improve your day to day conversation

A long time ago, one of my friends’ lost her parent. I recall feeling lost watching her navigate the turbulent times. She was miserable and had some dark times – it was difficult for me to watch.

I felt helpless – wanting to help but not knowing how to.

I tried various things in my attempt to make her feel better – until one day she snapped back

And told me – ‘I don’t want you to fix it. I want you to just listen to me’

And that is the incident I remembered now. This is what I should have done instead.

The book I am going to talk about today is I hear you by Michael Sorenson

This is a book that could have been an article. Thankfully it is a very short read.

This teaches you about the power of a very valuable \[yet, under-utilized skill\] – validation

It talks about how this skill helps improve relationships with your partner, navigate difficult relationships at work, connect at a deeper level with friends and family.

As social creatures we crave acceptance, appreciation and a sense of belonging

Essentially, validation means saying to someone, “I hear you. I get what you’re feeling, and it’s perfectly alright to feel that way’

Effective validation, he says has 2 components

It offers a specific emotion  
It offers justification for the feeling

Here is an example he provides

Say your co-worker seems a little distracted. Curious, you ask, whats up.

“Oh…my daughter was supposed to call when she got home from dance practice over an hour ago”, she says, but I haven’t heard back, so I’m a little worries.

What would you say?

Offer reassurance

\[Oh, I am sure, she is fine. You know how teenagers are, she probably forgot;}

Offer advice

\[You should call her friend\]

What is more effective is if you took a moment to validate. And say something on the lines of –

“I don’t blame you for being worried, especially if she said she will call an hour ago..”

Notice how we are \[1\] ‘identifying the emotion – worry” and \[2\] Offer justification \[its been an hour….\]

So in a nutshell, he recommends a 4 step validation process that one could apply to any situation

Listen empathically  
Validate the emotion  
Offer advise or encouragement \[if appropriate\[  
Validate the emotion again

It reads like a simplification of the psychologist John Gottman’s ‘bids for attention’ in a relationship.

Nonetheless, it’s a framework one could definitely adopt to one’s improve how you connect with people around you

The other day I used Google’s AR feature to get a 3D Tiger in my living room.

Much to the fascination of my 6 year old.

Of the most intriguing of the Technologies of the Future is AR and VR.

By mid 20’s estimates puts VR market at around $35 billion and it is hard to find a field that is not touch by this tech, says Peter Diamandis in his new book

> ‘Diagonelly” says Harry Potter, instead of Diagon Alley – teleporting himself into a different place in the book, Chamber of Secrets.

If you don’t fancy Floo Powder one could use Portkeys and Vanishing Cabinets for magically transporting self.

What if, in reality, you could get from A to B, without moving your body.

With tech that works like magic.

An Avatar \[Sanskrit for “incarnation of a deity in human or animal form to counteract some particular evil in the world”\] can be one of two forms –

A digital avatar – as you move in the real world, your avatar moves in the digital.

Robots are the second form of avatar – a humanoid robot.

“To be able to connect with loved ones you aren’t able to see often

Doctors and teachers are able to use their expertise anywhere in the world

Go into space or a disaster relief zone without risking human life

Sense the breeze, smell and interact with the remote environment

Scoop sand in the tropics and feel grains running through your fingers.”

Can this become ‘black mirrorish’ if we aren’t careful? Maybe.

As with any tech – this too is amplified by our intentions and actions of us.

Humans.

ANA has funded a $10M xPRize to speed up development of the robotic avatars

1) Musk plans to use his interplanetary starship for terrestrial passenger delivery

2) The starship travels at 17,500 mph – this means NewYork to Shanghai in 39 minutes. Or London to Dubai in 29 minutes

3) How close to real is this tech? April 2019 marked the first test flights of this rocket. This will erase long-haul flights and be worth £15bn a year by 2030, say experts

4) STARSHIP, SPACEX’S UNDER-CONSTRUCTION GIANT ROCKET, is about to make a big public appearance.

On October 2, CEO Elon Musk confirmed via Twitter the company’s ambitious project, designed to send the first humans to Mars, will release an update “in about three weeks.”

5) Sometime in the next decade or so, “Off to Europe for lunch”, may become a standard part of our lexicon.

#FlyingCars

1. US is home to 10 of the world’s 25 most congested cities costing $300 billion in lost income/productivity
2. Aerial ride sharing may sound like sci-fi but by mid-2019, over 1 billion USD had been invested in at least 25 different flying car companies.
3. Alphabet, Google’ s parent company, was amongst the first to recognize the potential and has personally funded Zee Aero, Opener and Kitty Hawk
4. The marginal cost of car ownership today is 59 cents per passenger mile \[It is $8.93/mile for a helicopter\]. Uber’s long term target is a game-changer at 44 cents/mile – cheaper than the cost of driving.
5. eVTOLS’ – electric Vertical Take-off and Landing vehicles\] are being developed by a number of companies. Uber is also partnering with NASA to develop air traffic management system & design ‘mega-skyports’

By 2030, urban aviation could be a major mode of getting from point A to B.

The flying cars promised by Jetsons’ seems to be here.

How fast is 5G?

With 3G, it takes forty-five minutes to download a high-definition movie.

4G shrinks that to twenty-one seconds.

But 5G?

It takes longer to read this sentence than it takes to download that movie.

In his latest book, Peter Diamandis, calls out 5G as one of the converging technologies that can disrupt the future.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FutureisFasterthanyourThink.jpg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)

5G, he says, will accelerate and deliver speeds that are a hundred times faster than what we currently experience at near-zero prices.

Fast and cheap always brings in adoption – and with it competition.

There are behemoths vying for real estate above our heads

Alphabet’s Project Loon, born out of Google X to replace terrestrial cell towers with stratospherically located balloons is now a reality.

Amazon joined the satellite competition in 2019 with Project Kuiper, a constellation of thousands of satellites designed to provide high speed broadband to the world

SpaceX has a 4 year head-start in providing global gigabit connections.

And finally, there is the David amongst all the Goliath’s – engineer Greg Wyler who is working on OneWeb to bring 5G to everyone.

Book – [Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc)

8 lessons from Pixar on how to build and foster a culture of creativity!

Interesting to hear Pixar’s history told first-hand, through the eyes of the co-founder, Ed Catmull along with his interactions with Steve Jobs.

If you are a leader looking to learn what it means to ‘manage well’ and hearing Pixar’s story first hand, then pick this up!

##### 1) Dailies or solving problems together

  
Dailies are a key part of Pixar culture. The dailies keep everybody in top form because the goal is to create the best animation possible. There are debates because the director doesn’t have all the answers – we work it out together. It is a group effort that doesn’t come naturally. Everyone wants to impress and no one wants to share their incomplete work or in conceived ideas or sound dumb in front of the director. The first step is to teach them how everyone shows incomplete work at Pixar. And how everyone is free to make suggestions and when they realize this the embarrassment goes away and people become more creative.  
By making the struggles to solve the problems safe to discuss, everyone learns from and inspires each other – the whole activity becomes socially rewarding and productive.  
Designed to promote everyone’s ability to be open to others by the insight that individual creativity is magnified by the people around you. The result – we see more clearly.

##### 2) Research trips

References to other movies come up during film making. He calls out how they joke at pixar that only one star wars mention is allowed per meeting. References to other movies both good and bad are part of the vocabulary but if you rely too much on drawing inspiration your movie becomes just an ape of the masters.  
We must go out and do research. When they were making a movie of a rat that aspires to become a Chef, the members of Ratatouille went to Paris to visiting Michelin starred kitchens and interviewing their chefs. An ostrich was bought into the office to help the animators who were modeling the character in the movie up.   
In Finding nemo, when the plotline emerged that nemo wanted to escape by jumping into a sink with the assumption that all drain-lines end up into a ocean, a trip was arranged to the SF treatment plant and yes, it is possible is what they learnt. Many of the crew also became scuba certified. Many of these experiences are not diversion – they fuel the films development. These tiny details are what lends authenticity in the final film – they don’t know what they are lo  
You will never stumble on the unexpected if you stick to the familiar – they always come back changed. Challenge our preconceived notion and fuel inspiration – they are what keeps us creating rather than copying.  
It comes through even if the movie goers don’t know anything about the reality. Very few movie goers may have been in the high end kitchen of a Parisian restaurant so the chefs clogs clacking on the black and white tiles or how they hold their arms when they chop would be lost – but to the audience, it does feel right. 

#####   
3) Power of limits

  
Or the Beautifully shaded penny problem. Artists who work on our films care so much about every detail that they would spend hours or weeks crafting an equivalent of a penny on a night stand that you will never see. The desire for quality can get well beyond rationality. Overbuilt just to be safe. How can you tell people to care less or be less excellent. How do we set useful limits and how do we make them visible. Finite resources – deadlines – a shifting economy – all of these external factors impose limits. The concept of a limit implies you cant do everything you want so you must think of smarter ways to work. Limits force us to rethink how we work and push us to new heights to creativity – appetite control. In any creativity endeavor there is a very long list of what we want to bring in to achieve greatness – at some point we set deadlines and prioritization. If you wait too long to do this you run out of resources. System of identifying what was possible with the given resources. Johns system consisted of popsicle sticks stuck with Velcro – each stick was a person week that a single animator could accomplish. A bunch of sticks would be lined up next to a character for easy reference – a glance will tell you that if you use this many on one you will have less on the other.

#####   
4) Integrating technology and art

  
Walt Disney was unrelenting in bringing in tech into animation industry – integrating tech, art and business. Balance of all three is required. Art challenges tech and tech inspires art. Art and tech play off each other. Example – way to draw on top of a projected image to communicate the views to the animators. The result – review sketch tool – digital stylus to draw directly on top of an image that saves sketches and makes them available online. This eventually became an essential tool for all directors. 

##### 5) Short Experiments

  
Justify what we do. Not be required to justify everything and leave door open for the unexpected. When you embark on an experiment you don’t know how this will work out – short films are used for such experimenting. Would encourage experimentation and also be a proving ground for fledging directors. They are a relatively inexpensive way to screw up. Mistakes are not avoidable but learnable opportunities.

#####   
6) Learning to see

Pixar introduced a 10 week program for new hires to use the software – Pixar University. Majority of employees aren’t artists – wanted people to understand how to heighten powers of observation. Concept of left and right brain. Drawing required shutting left mode off – suppress the part of the brain that sees an image as only an image and not as an object. Art teachers place an object upside down so that they can look at it as a pure shape and not a recognizable thing. Focus on negative spaces. Artists see more since they have turned off their brains instinct to jump to conclusions- Art classes are not about learning to draw but learning to see. With practice you can teach your brain to observe without letting judgements kicking.

Real point is you can learn to set aside pre-conceptions – not that you don’t have biases but you can learn to ignore them. As a parallel he suggests that – looks at the environment instead of focusing on the problem will give us better insights 

##### 7) Post mortems

  
Meeting held shortly after the completion of every movie which we explore what did and didn’t work and consolidate lessons learnt. We become exceptional by understanding ways in which we arent exceptional. Post mortems are one of the ways to do that.  
○ Consolidate what has been learnt, Others to learn or challenge  
○ Do not let resentments fester – provide forum to address and let go  
○ Use the schedule to force reflection   
○ Pay it forward  
○ Ask everyone in the room to make a list – top 5 things they would do again and top 5 they wouldn’t do again. Balance negative with the positive.

#####   
8) Continuing to learn

Expanding PU’s curriculum. Sitting next to people across teams that proved very valuable – free to be open and vulnerable and communication tried. Toiled side by side – taming a lump of clay – no matter their title to respect work that their colleagues did and make us beginners again. Operate on the edge. Classes will be useful- never to turn programmers into artists – importance of every one of us to learn new things.   
First and second grade drawing looked fresher than the older grades – somewhere along the line they had become more self conscious and thus become more stilted – fear of judgement hindered creativity

Hi All!

Here is your weekly dose of “5 Point Saturdays,” – interesting tidbits from what I have been Reading: Latest reviews, Books, Weekly challenges, Learning Hacks, and More!

What am I reading

[Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That Will Improve and/or Ruin Everything ](https://www.amazon.in/Soonish-Emerging-Technologies-Improve-Everything/dp/B0764LK7NZ/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dchild=1&keywords=Soonish&qid=1600505492&sr=8-1)

What will the world of tomorrow be like? How does progress happen? And why do we not have a lunar colony already?

In this book, the authors give us a snapshot of the transformative technologies that are coming next – from robot swarms to nuclear fusion powered-toasters – and explain how they will change our world in astonishing ways. By weaving together their own research and interviews with pioneering scientists, they investigate why these innovations are needed, how they would work, and what is standing in their way. 

What did I learn new?

In the movie Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khans, a fascinating new technology called Genesis Device was introduced. It was capable of transforming dead planets into lush, livable worlds almost instantly. It would explode like a bomb and release a spray of highly bioengineered DNA. As this super DNA spreads to all corners of the planet, the cells would take root and dense jungles would form until the entire planet is terraformed within a matter of days. 

In 2016, there was a paper published detailing what a real life Genesis device might look like. The professor predicts that a primitive version would be possible in 50 to 100 years.

This is an excerpt from the book – Future of Humanity on terraforming Mars and building a destiny for humanity beyond earth. It is an exciting time to be alive.

Productivity Hack I am trying out

You might have heard of [Bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/about) \[oft called the ‘Konmari for your racing thoughts’\] – which is described as a mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity system. It’s designed to help you organize your what while you remain mindful of your why.

I recently set up Trello boards for daily, weekly and monthly logs to help out with Bullet journalling online. Tremendously useful!

Here is a link that helped – [How to Use a Bullet Journal in Trello to Plan Your Day](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-bullet-journal-trello-plan-day/#:~:text=With%20your%20Trello%20boards%20all,Daily%20Logs%20ahead%20of%20time.)

Movie I highly recommend

I hardly watch TV. I don’t trust my will power enough to stay away from the constantly streaming media doling out series and latest movies so I don’t subscribe to them.

But this one came so highly recommended that I made an exception to the no-movie rule. 

I am reading Creativity Inc by Pixar’s co-founder Ed Catmull which spoke about the making of this movie – ‘Inside Out’.

What a solid movie. Absolutely brilliant. Do watch.

Here is the trailer link – [Inside Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seMwpP0yeu4)

Poetry that I am ruminating about –

**If you forget me – Pablo Neruda**

> “Well, now,  
> if little by little you stop loving me  
> I shall stop loving you little by little.  
> If suddenly  
> you forget me  
> do not look for me,  
> for I shall already have forgotten you.”

###### What is Critical Thinking?

By definition – ‘The objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgement’ is termed as Critical thinking.

###### Why be a critical thinker?

Being a critical thinker sets you apart from the crowd instantly – it allows you to be a more perceptive and logical thinker without falling into the trap of your learnt personal biases.

For example, if you could stop to review the confrontation with your loved ones or in deciding whether you want to pick the new diet plan that promises washboard abs. It could be in deciding the strategy on the way ahead for the product you manage at work or in analyzing how your team could contribute to the overall sales target. It could also be in questioning your current beliefs and debunking principles you have followed sans reasons.

In this video, Samantha Agoos explains a simple system for approaching any problem or tough decision in your life.

###### Step 1 – Formulate your question

Know what you are looking for.

For example, if you deciding whether to try out the newest diet craze that shows results in 2 weeks pause to ask yourself – What are you trying to accomplish by dieting?  
Weight Loss, Better nutrition or More energy? Your reasons may be obscured by other factors such as seeing results in 2 weeks. Thinking critically will help you sift through the information to see if the fad really suits your needs.

###### Step 2 – Gather your information

There is an overwhelming amount of information around. Having the right question will help you get to the relevant information. Get more information about the problem or decision at hand. Ask an expert or seek testimony from those who have experienced it. This helps weigh different options before you pick one.

###### 

###### Step 3 – Apply the information

What does this imply? Ask critical questions when facing a decision. About what concepts are at work and what assumptions exist. Ask yourself if the interpretation of the information is logically sound.  
For example, in an email that promises you millions, consider what is shaping your approach and considering the evidence, if you will win any money at all.

###### Step 4 – Consider the implications

Say you are picking a politician for voting. Even if the immediate promises may seem luring, think of unintended long term consequences. Is that something you are going to be agreeable to?

###### Step 5 – Explore other Point of Views (PoV)

When facing a decision, take a minute to think of the issue from the other person’s perspective. Say, during elections, stop to consider why are so many folks drawn to the opposing POV. Alternatives allow you to get the others’ perspective, evaluate choices and ultimately make better informed decisions.

This framework also seems to map out very closely to [IDEO’s Design thinking Flow](https://www.ideou.com/pages/design-thinking)

> “If our long term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds” – Carl Sagan

It is inescapable as the laws of physics that humanity will one day confront some type of extinction-level event.

If we scan all life-forms that have ever existed on the Earth from microscopic bacteria to towering forests, lumbering dinosaurs to enterprising humans, we find that more than 99.9 % of them eventually became extinct. This means extinction is the norm. The Earth has already sustained 5 major extinction cycles, in which up to 90% of life forms vanished from earth.

But if there is one lesson we can learn from history, it is that humanity, when faced with life threatening crises, has risen to the challenge and reached for even higher goals.

Life is too precious to be placed on a single planet, to be at the mercy of these planetary threats. We should become a ‘two-planet species’.

This extract is from Michio Kaku’s book – [The Future of Humanity](https://www.amazon.in/Future-Humanity-Michio-Kaku/dp/0241304849) – Terraforming Mars, Interstellar travel, Immortality and destiny beyond earth.

This longer term perspective highlights our ‘responsibility to deal more kindly with one another’ and more importantly, raise children who are comfortable in navigating a future very unlike our own.

> Life is not happening to you – life is happening for you. This is a powerful shift in our attitude.

This morning, the topic of my meditation was highly relevant to our times. 

On resilience. 

The guide narrated a story that was simple yet thought provoking – one I have recounted below.

Given than most of us have been stuck at home for more than 6 months now, this is highly pertinent a topic towards managing our mental health.

I have been focusing on the concept of ‘reinventing oneself during the pandemic’ in my daily journal – for that gives me a purpose to be. 

The below story thus resonated well with me and I hope it does with you too.

There is a young lady and she is having many kinds of challenges in her life. She comes to her mother to complain about it. Her mother just smiles and leads her to the kitchen. She puts three pots of water and starts boiling them and her daughter is wondering what’s going on. In one she puts carrots, in another she adds eggs and in the third she adds coffee beans.

And as the water comes to a boil, she removes each of those three vessels and as it cools down she asks her daughter to examine the three vessels. The daughter finds that the carrots have become very soft, the eggs have become quite hard and the water with the coffee has gotten colored. She turns and asks her mother, ‘ What is this. What are you trying to teach me?’

The mother smiles and says, ‘the carrots went in really hard and strong and came out quite soft. The eggs went in quite fragile and came out pretty hard. The coffee beans look pretty much the same but the water has been completely transformed.

So life is like this. All those three – the carrot, the eggs and the coffee beans faced the same adversity – boiling water. And yet the response is quite different. So as the challenges come in our life, how are we going to respond?

Are we going to go in hard and then become all disheartened and soft?

Are we going to go in very open-hearted and then become hard-hearted. Outwardly looking the same but inwardly very brittle. 

Or are we going to be like the coffee bean – when the adversity comes, the situations themselves get transformed.

So learn how to activate the coffee bean attitude within us – the beautiful skill of resilience.

The idea, the guide points out, is that “**What we resist in life, will persist**. **Whatever we welcome, it is not a problem anymore”**

Suffering is any experience multiplied by resistance and happiness is any experience multiplied by acceptance.

Life is not happening to you – life is happening for you.

This is a powerful shift in our attitude. Whatever comes up you say, ‘bring it on’.

Bring it On.

## The Medici Effect : What Elephants and Epidemics Can Teach Us About Innovation

Diversity drives innovation – We’ll today talk about how break through insights lies at the intersection of ideas, fields and cultures

Can you imagine what safety engineering can learn from insects?

Have you seen images of locusts fly in swarms? Have you ever wondered how they do so without colliding with each other? Some scientists did. They discovered the African locust has a unique internal radar system composed of a giant movement detector behind the eyes. The visual input is instantly transmitted to the insect’s wing nerve cells – seemingly bypassing the brain. The detector releases bursts of energy when the locust is on a collision course, which allows it to move out of the way quickly.   
This lead to Volvo Safety divisions building collusion safety based on how the locust’s radar system to develop new technology to cut down on road traffic accidents.

What comes across through this examples – is that creativity and innovation is driven through diversity and the cross fertilization of fields.

In the Medici effect, owes its name to the rich banker family which had a lot of influence in Italy in the 15 century and unleashed an explosion of creativity during this period, ultimately laying the foundation for Renaissance

Johansson calls working at the intersection of disciplines that spurs creativity and innovation as the Medici Effect.

###### Quantity of ideas increases the quality of ideas.

1\. Produce as many ideas as possible  
2\. Produce ideas as wild as possible  
3\. Build upon each other’s ideas  
4\. Avoid passing judgement on ideas

###### Create new ideas

Through exposing to a range of cultures, teach yourself many different things, reverse your assumptions, and take on multiple perspectives of a specific situation.

###### How many times can one discover a new continent

The point he is trying to make is that there is only so much one can learn from within a field. The foundational framework across most disciplines are already discovered – the world, moving ahead, he says lies in the inter disciplinary fields

> “Leonardo da Vinci, the defining Renaissance man and perhaps the greatest intersectionalist of all times, believed that in order to fully understand something one needed to view it from at least three different perspectives”

### The Art of Creating a Life While Making a Living 

### – Lessons from a Startup VC 

“And then there is the most dangerous risk of all- the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later”

_“If your life were to end suddenly and unexpectedly tomorrow, would you be able to say you’ve been doing what you truly care about today?._ 

_What would you be willing to do for the rest of your life?”_

If you are one who believes you need to work the majority of life doing something you don’t want to do, so you can eventually retire and _then_ devote your time to your passion then this book is for you.

This is the idea of the ‘Deferred Life plan’ – if there is only one thing you want to take away from this book then this is the one.

My parents lived their whole lives like this. There are people who go into something they don’t love but hope will make them enough money so that they would eventually do something else later

The problem is our life’s timeline is unknown. We may never reach “one day.”

That step 1 you do what you must then step two do what you want – it implies that what we must do is necessarily different from what we want to do. 

Essentially the life we want cannot exist without doing something unsatisfactory? He calls out that while sacrifice and hard work is necessary as part of step 1, why not do it because it is meaningful and not just to get over it to move to the step 2.

He then talks about the Whole Life plan – work hard, work passionately, but apply your most precious asset – time- to what is most meaningful to you. What are you willing to do for the rest of your life.

This is an interesting distinction that I had never thought of earlier. In reference to the steps in the Deferred Life Plan, drive is what you experience in the first step, and passion is what you hope to experience after you’ve put in your time.

“Passion pulls you toward something you cannot resist. Drive pushes you toward something you feel compelled or obligated to do.”

Chosen as one of the Top 100 Business books of all time, the book I referenced to is The Monk and the Riddle

I picked this up because I wanted to learn the inner workings of the silicon valley startups – from ideation to how they get launched, to how venture capitalists do deals to how plans get pitched an insider perspective from a startup investor. But I came out of it learning more than that.

Silicon Valley is filled with garage-to-riches stories and hot young entrepreneurs with big ideas.

This book describes the journey of one Silicon Valley insider has blazed a path of professional – and personal – success playing the game by his own rules.

Randy Comisar is a ‘virtual CEO’, a startup investor and provides ‘leadership on demand’ to several companies

The story opens with the author on a motorcycle journey through Miramar, where he meets a monk who poses a riddle:

“Imagine I have an egg and I want to drop this egg three feet without breaking it. How do I do that?”

It is a business book quite unlike the others, where instead of using a framework, Komisar takes us through a narrative of a dialogue between himself and would be startups.

It unfolds to showcase not just the inner workings of the VC and startup world but leaves one with differences between leadership and management, passion vs drive and finally what it means to succeed personally and professionally.

As Keynes postulated, **in the long run, we’re all dead. Time is the only resource that matters.**

Choose where you want to spend it.

Hi All!

Here is your weekly dose of “5 Point Saturdays,” interesting tidbits from what I have been Reading: Latest reviews, Books, Weekly challenges, Learning Hacks, and More!

##### **Point \[1\] – What I’m reading** 

[Monk and the Riddle: The Art of Creating a Life While Making a Living](https://www.amazon.in/Monk-Riddle-Creating-Making-Living/dp/1578516447/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dchild=1&keywords=the+monk+and+the+riddle&qid=1597405381&sr=8-1). Here is one of my favorite quotes in the piece:

> “.._And then there is the most dangerous risk of all — the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later._”

##### **Point 2\] What I came across this week that really impacted me** 

21 Principles for Innovating – from IDEO’s partner, Diego Rodriguez I’ve been doing this online course from Stanford on ‘[Leading Innovation](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xine229-leading-innovation)‘ . As part of the module that talks about the differences between creative and routine work, the professor introduces IDEO’s former partner Diego Rodriguez and his 21 principles for Innovation. The 19th principle is to ‘Be remarkable’. I created a PDF version of the 21 principles that you can download for free from [here – 21 Principles of Innovation](https://ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21PrinciplesforInnovation-1.pdf). 

##### **Point 3\] Weekly Challenge that I’m playing around with**

21 day Food Journaling Challenge**.** You can only manage what you measure! I use this simple version of a food tracking journal to capture anything I eat, including liquids. Apart from providing me startling revelations of the quantity I consume, this also has been helping create a Pavlovian response – I don’t eat that cookie since I don’t want to write it on the journal! Find a free pdf download of the planner I use [here](https://ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Food-Journal.jpg)!

##### **Point 4\] What I’m listening to** 

**“**[**LEAP – Stanford eCorner Podcast series**](https://ecorner.stanford.edu/series/leap/)**”** (it takes a deep dive into how to launch your career by unpacking the often overlooked and under-taught soft skills critical to the success of every entrepreneur) hosted by Stanford Professor, [Tina Seelig](https://ecorner.stanford.edu/contributor/tina-seelig/)

##### **Point 5\] Book I read but won’t review!** 

Sometimes, the back to back reading \[and listening\] of non-fiction is overwhelming and like a friend pointed out, one needs a ‘palate cleanser’ that is light and doesn’t need us to think.

This time, I picked up this adorable British romantic comedy, touted as the bestseller for 2019 – [The Flatshare](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36478784-the-flatshare), Beth O’Leary

Quite a unique storyline, captured in a quite an heartwarming manner.

Here is the Goodreads synopsis of the book:

Tiffy and Leon share a flat

Tiffy and Leon share a bed

Tiffy and Leon have never met…

Tiffy Moore needs a cheap flat, and fast. Leon Twomey works nights and needs cash. Their friends think they’re crazy, but it’s the perfect solution: Leon occupies the one-bed flat while Tiffy’s at work in the day, and she has the run of the place the rest of the time.

But with obsessive ex-boyfriends, demanding clients at work, wrongly imprisoned brothers and, of course, the fact that they still haven’t met yet, they’re about to discover that if you want the perfect home you need to throw the rulebook out the window…

Everyone deserves some goofy laughs – go ahead and pick up the book [here](https://www.amazon.in/Flatshare-Beth-OLeary-ebook/dp/B07DCZ7LM4/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dchild=1&keywords=Flatshare&qid=1597406945&sr=8-1). No one is judging you 🙂

##### **\[Point 1\] What I’m reading \[or listening to on Audible\] —**

[1) American Dirt, Jeanine Cummins](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07NCZLPL6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?%5Fencoding=UTF8&btkr=1) – This extraordinary 2020 published book by an American author was featured as part of Oprah’s book club and soon catapulted to fame. Captivating from the very first page, this book talks about the ordeal of a Mexican woman who had to leave behind her life and escape as an undocumented immigrant to the United States with her son….. There is also tremendous amount of controversy surrounding the book around racist stereotyping by the American author….

2) [Secrets of Sandhill Road, Venture capital and How to Get it, Scott Kupor](https://www.amazon.in/Secrets-Sand-Hill-Road-Capital-ebook/dp/B07KLJQ13R/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=IB4SHDG71XE7&dchild=1&keywords=secrets+of+sand+hill+road&qid=1598685811&s=digital-text&sprefix=Secrets+of+san%2Cdigital-text%2C317&sr=1-1) – Authored by the managing partner at Andersen Horowitz, this book is called the ‘definitive guide to how to engage the VC community, including governance and other best practices in a startup’s journey to a successful public company. 

Sand Hill Road is for Silicon Valley in the same way as Hollywood is for Actors, Wall Street is for investment bankers, Music Row is for country music artists.

Going by the reviews and the initial chapters, this seems to be a fantastic book if you want to learn about Venture Capital!

3) [Creativity Inc, Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration, Ed Catmull](https://www.amazon.in/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration-ebook/dp/B00GUOEMA4/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dchild=1&keywords=Creativity+Inc&qid=1598685860&s=digital-text&sr=1-1)

“What does it mean to manage well?”

From Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios, comes an incisive book about creativity in business—sure to appeal to readers of Daniel Pink, Tom Peters, and Chip and Dan Heath. Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.”

##### **Point 2\] Time management hack that I am trying out —** 

Planning out my day in pomodoros instead of keeping a to-do list.

What is the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro%5FTechnique)?

 1\. Choose a task you’d like to get done · 2\. Set the Pomodoro for 25 minutes · 3\. Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings. 4\. Checkbox item completed. 5.Take a short break of 5 mins 6\. Every 4 pomodoros take a longer break of 15 mins.

Why does it work?

Ensuring you are not checking emails or your mobile every two minutes allows one to concentrate on the task at hand without constant context switching

##### **Point 3\] New tool that has made my WFH life easier!**

Apart from my airy and sunny corner besides the window that serves as my workspace, I also got this Wall-mount standing desk from an on-line retailer that has been brilliant!

Imagine a terrible epidemic has broken out in a community and you are the healthcare strategist in charge for taking action. It is believed that 600 lives are at stake and you could choose between one of two vaccines

1. The first vaccine will definitely save 200 lives
2. The second vaccine is experimental and has a uncertain outcome. It offers a 33% chance that all 600 people will be saved but a 67% chance that no one will be saved. What will you do?

Kahneman found in his studies that most people choose to save the 200 lives \[Option 1\]

Now imagine instead think about choosing the following two options –

1. With the first vaccine 400 of the 600 people will die
2. With the second vaccine is experimental and has an uncertain outcome. It provides a 33% chance that no one will die and a 67% chance that everyone will die.

What will you do?

In this version 78% of the respondents said that they will try the experimental vaccine.

This is interesting since the two situations are exactly the same – just expressed differently.

In the first case, the situation was framed as saving 200 lives and the second as letting 400 people die.

People’s risk taking behavior changes significantly depending on how they read ‘save’ and ‘die’

This famous experiments shows how people are deeply influenced by how the problem is framed.

The same situation may seem risk and safe by the same person. 

Research says that is is better to view risk from many different perspectives or frames of reference.

If we maintain frames of reference of standard disciplinary fields when working at the intersection then we will always come to the conclusion that the risk is too great.

Even the best inter sectional idea can seem too risky when viewed from the wrong frame of reference.

How do we move past this?

By Shifting the perspective. For example, Richard Bran son values the fun of doing something different.

His strategy is to intersect Virgin businesses with a variety of different business opportunities. He is not sure up front if it will work – but if involves something fun and intrinsically motivating he is taking a very small risk of being bored.

Another perspective – doing something differently is the only chance to make it says the chef, Marcus Samuelson. 

If he has stuck within the established field of cooking, he would have been much more difficult to innovation.

” It is virtually impossible not to come out of the intersection – the white space between disciplines – without a vastly expanded set of future opportunities.”

“I couldn’t put this down. I’ll never stop thinking about it’, reads a review of this title. I can’t agree more.

The gorgeous book I am going to talk about today is ‘American Dirt’, by Jeanine Cummins

Being part of Oprah’s book club, this book soon gained popularity and with it, controversy around its stereotypical depictions.

The novel about the Mexican mother and her young son fleeing to the US border by an American author with an ‘ intent to shine the spotlight on tragedies facing immigrants’, has received much flak by Mexican American authors who have criticized the seemingly well intentioned novel for the not so flattering stereotypical depictions of the crime scene and Mexico drug cartels.

And I hear where they come from.

American Dirt tells this story of Lydia Perez, a middle class Mexican book seller with a pretty perfect life – a loving husband, family and son until a man walks in to her book store. Seemingly erudite and conversant, she soon is enraptured by how much they share and in finding a true friend when she discovers he is in reality the drug cartel lord that her journalist husband has been trying to expose.

The narrative follows the journey as she flees her town with her 8 year old son after the drug cartel violently attacks a quinceanera she is attending after killing the rest of her family.

In their attempt at outrunning the cartel, Lydia and her son soon find themselves making the treacherous journey to US on a freight train at the mercy of fate, and some good fellow immigrants along the way as they fight their way to the US border.

Whilst as an outsider I cannot necessarily comment on the accuracy of the portrayal, the story was powerfully moving. The heartbreakingly thrilling journey escaping from the Los Jardineros cartel by being strapped on top of a moving train is a page turner.

Cummins has managed to come up with a gripping and compelling narrative – of characters we meet along the journey, their disappointments and heart wrenching background stories.

Critics have called this ‘ harmful and appropriating melodrama’ which resonated. I have been in conversations with well-intentioned outsiders, trying hard not to step into jingoism in defending my country whilst at the same time blazing red at questions aimed at knowing whether I live in a dump as portrayed in SlumDog Millionaire.

It is a sensitive issue and there is a fine line between the white and the black.

Cummins mentioned in an interview, “migrants at the Mexican border were being portrayed as ‘a faceless brown mass.’ She said she wanted to give these people a face.”

So while the criticism may be valid, the relevance of the story isn’t diminished. It is a riveting tale of humanity and dreams of a better future.

On the border wall of Tijuana \[US-Mexican border\], the book reads, there is wonderful piece of graffiti.

#PODSHORTS

Genre – NonFiction – Work, Management

Book 33/52

Book – [Linchpin, Seth Godin](https://www.amazon.in/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591844096)

_“There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labour. Now there’s a third team, the linchpins. These people invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They figure out what to do when there’s no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art.”_

Are you indispensable?  
At your career and in life? Or are you just a cog in the wheel who can be easily replaced?

In the book, very aptly titled, Linchpin, Seth Godin talks about how to become one.

Linchpins he says are essential blocks of organizations and in today’s world, they get the best jobs and freedom.

There is a village in China – Outside of Shenzen called Dafen. It is said that 60% of new oil paintings worldwide was produced here. The workers in Dafen – while diligent and talented arent artists – they are painters. Cogs in a painting machine. Seth talks about 2 paintings he owns in Dafen for 60 USD each. Who knows which Dafen resident painted them – no one. Who cares – no one. The painters are replaceable.

We will talk about two key topics we from this book today –

###### **1) Why do you and your organization benefit from linchpins – the story of France vs UK**

  
This is becoming more essential in order to survive in the workplace because the days of being a cog in the wheel are over both for ourselves and the teams we lead. Back in the day, we bought into a mentality of a factory work where, in exchange for doing what we were told and what was expected of us without any resistance, we were rewarded – with a paycheck, with health insurance or with job security.

As we all know, those days have disappeared – but that “factory” mindset still persists. According to Godin, one of the only ways to survive this new world of work is by becoming a linchpin.

The challenge on becoming a linchpin solely based on your skill – since the market that can find other people with that skill with surprising ease. Plenty of people can play the flute as well as you can, program in python as well as you can.

  
**_If all you can do is the task and you are not in a league of your own in doing the task – you are not indispensable._** 

  
On the other hand, emotional labor is rarely used as a competitive advantage – we spend our time trying to perfect our craft, we don’t focus on the skills and interactions that will allow us to stand out and become indispensable to our organization.

He gives the example of France vs UK to make the point

France vs UK – When France was embracing hand-made luxury, great Britain was embracing the anonymous factory. Made in France came to mean something and still does. Mechanizing and cheapening the process would have it made it easier for others to copy. Relying on humanity made it difficult and scarce. Scarcity creates value.

Showing up and staying through the day of your job is good. Meeting the spec is meeting expectations. Problem with meeting expectations is that it is not remarkable – and it is easy to emulate which makes you easy to replace.

###### 2) So how do you become a linchpin

“The job is what you do when you are told what to do. The job is showing up at the factory, following instructions, meeting spec, and being managed.

Someone can always do your job a little better or faster or cheaper than you can.

  
Your art is what you do when no one can tell you exactly how to do it. Your art is the act of taking personal responsibility, challenging the status quo, and changing people.

I call the process of doing your art ‘the work.’ It’s possible to have a job and do the work, too.   
Solve problems people haven’t predicted. Sees things people haven’t seen and connects people who need to be connected

Be an artist

“There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labour. Now there’s a third team, the linchpins. These people invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They figure out what to do when there’s no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art.”

  
He talks of how both the enterprises and the individuals benefit from linchpins in the hybrid economy

When you start down the path of beating the competition based on something they can be easily measured, you are betting that with practice and determination you can do better than others all the time and you cant.

1) The Poverty mindset and Shipping

The poverty mentality – if you I give you something, the less I have. The more you share, the more I lose. This is what we have been taught for a long time. Digital goods have broken up this zero sum scenario – if you are willing to share your attention for my idea, we both thrive.

When you give something away – you benefit more than the recipient does. The act of being generous makes you rich beyond measure. Everyone benefits.

This is what he says on shipping aka getting stuff done and out –  
“The only purpose of starting is to finish, and while the projects we do are never really finished, they must ship. Shipping means hitting the publish button on your blog, showing a presentation to the sales team, answering the phone, selling the muffins, sending out your references. Shipping is the collision between your work and the outside world.” 

From <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7155145-linchpin>

Solve problems people haven’t predicted. Sees things people haven’t seen and connects people who need to be connected

Be an artist – choose to make a difference instead of following a manual. Dream up new ideas and make them real.

How to be a linchpin or an artist? There is no map. You must make your own.

> “How do we distribute wealth in a world where humans do not work?”

There is a lot of buzz around our future. 

Mankind’s future. 

On [Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological%5Fsingularity). On AI. On misinformation around AI.

The hype around Deep Learning. On [Universal Basic Income](https://www.thebalance.com/universal-basic-income-4160668) (UBI) and the arguments for and against it.

And most importantly on the anxiety we seem to share – of losing our jobs and ourselves to machines who can better us. So what really is the future of work. And of us? 

**It is more than just an ethical question – an economic one.**  

There are a lot of great books around the topic if you’d like to learn more – here is a handy list – 

1. Abundance – The Future is better than you think, Peter Diamandis
2. Our Final Invention, James Barrat
3. The Rational Optimist – how prosperity evolves, Matt Ridley
4. Make your own neural network – Tariq Rashid
5. The Rise of Robots, Martin Ford
6. Surviving AI, Calum Chase
7. The Future of the Professions: How Technology Will Transform the Work of Human Experts Paperback, Richard Susskind

Getting back to the topic at hand – I recently heard this podcast from TED talks on **3 myths about the future of work** (and why they’re not true) by Daniel Susskind

Daniel Susskind is an economist and the co-author of the last book in the above list. I also found his talk exceptionally coherent

This article is detailed review of his TED talk and how it makes so much sense. Also, he points out as to **how we are actually trying to solve the wrong problems**.

There is this question that struck me at the end of the talk that has stayed since I heard this – “How do we distribute wealth in a world where humans do not work? “

**TL:DR – “Will machines replace humans?”**

This question is on the mind of anyone with a job to lose. 

Daniel Susskind confronts this question and three misconceptions we have about our automated future, suggesting we ask something else:   

> How will we distribute wealth in a world when there will be less — or even no — work?

Automation anxiety has been spreading lately, a fear that in the future, many jobs will be performed by machines rather than human beings, given the remarkable advances that are unfolding in artificial intelligence and robotics. What’s clear is that there will be significant change. What’s less clear is what that change will look like. My research suggests that the future is both troubling and exciting.”

Here is him tacking the three myths we often come across –

##### Myth 1 – Terminator Myth : Machine Substitution harms humans

‘Machines don’t just substitute for humans’  
We are constantly confront across media with reports of how hordes of machine might descend on mankind in the near future to displace humans from our jobs – he calls this the ‘Terminator Myth’. Yet, he states that machines can displace humans in specific tasks, but they ‘don’t just substitute for humans’. Work can be made more valuable in instances where humans can complement a machine. “

An architect can use computer-assisted design software to design bigger, more complicated buildings”

#####  How Technological Progress impacts the overall Pie

“_The first is if we think of the economy as a pie, technological progress makes the pie bigger. As productivity increases, incomes rise and demand grows. The British pie, for instance, is more than a hundred times the size it was 300 years ago”_. People who are displaced from the old pie can thus find tasks to do in the new pie.

###### Technological Progress also changes the contents of the Pie

“New industries are created, new tasks have to be done and that means often new roles have to be filled. So again, the British pie: 300 years ago, most people worked on farms, 150 years ago, in factories, and today, most people work in offices”

These are called ‘**_Complementaries_**‘.

###### Reality 1 – We just saw as to how complementaries can do just the opposite

##### 

##### Myth 2 – Intelligence Myth 

The belief that machines have to copy the way that human beings think and reason in order to outperform them.

He explains this through the example of how, until recently, we had rule based systems and held an assumption that tasks such as driving a car or making a medical diagnosis couldn’t be readily automated. Because the assumption was that machines could only automate where a human could capture and explain to a machine as to how something ought to be done – through a set of instructions. This was the view popular in AI in the 1980s.

The very resurgence of AI now is due to the fact that it doesn’t work that way anymore. Machine Learning algorithms works by learning from historical data – exactly like we humans do through experiences. Not really through a set of rules.

##### Reality 2 

“Resolving the intelligence myth shows us that our limited understanding about human intelligence, about how we think and reason, is far less of a constraint on automation than it was in the past. What’s more, as we’ve seen, when these machines perform tasks differently to human beings, there’s no reason to think that what human beings are currently capable of doing represents any sort of summit in what these machines might be capable of doing in the future”

##### Myth 3 – The Superiority Myth

Here Daniel Susskind refers to what he calls the ‘l[ump of labor fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump%5Fof%5Flabour%5Ffallacy)‘

” It was a British economist, David Schloss, who gave it this name in 1892\. He was puzzled to come across a dock worker who had begun to use a machine to make washers, the small metal discs that fasten on the end of screws. And this dock worker felt guilty for being more productive. Now, most of the time, we expect the opposite, that people feel guilty for being unproductive. But this worker felt guilty for being more productive, and asked why, he said, “I know I’m doing wrong. I’m taking away the work of another man.” In his mind, there was some fixed lump of work to be divided up between him and his pals, so that if he used this machine to do more, there’d be less left for his pals to do. Schloss saw the mistake.

The lump of work wasn’t fixed. As this worker used the machine and became more productive, the price of washers would fall, demand for washers would rise, more washers would have to be made, and there’d be more work for his pals to do.

**The lump of work would get bigger.**

Schloss called this “**the lump of labor fallacy.”**

In case you missed it- the key is that – **the lump of labor wasn’t fixed**.

He talks about how though many people use this as an argument, in reality, there really is no fixed lump of work to be divvied up between people and machines.

“Here’s the mistake: it’s right to think that technological progress makes the lump of work to be done bigger. Some tasks become more valuable. New tasks have to be done. But it’s wrong to think that necessarily, human beings will be best placed to perform those tasks. And this is the superiority myth. Yes, the lump of work might get bigger and change, but as machines become more capable, it’s likely that they’ll take on the extra lump of work themselves”

Going back to what we saw initially around the ‘economic pie’ – hence, ‘ The economic pie may change, but as machines become more capable, it’s possible that they’ll be best placed to do the new tasks that have to be done’.

So what is the conclusion? I thought this was the most critical part of his entire 15 min speech. Thus here it is. Please Read. And Re-read.

##### So what do these three myths tell us then?

Resolving the Terminator myth shows us that the future of work depends upon this balance between two forces: 

1) Machine substitution that harms workers but also those complementarities that do the opposite. And until now, this balance has fallen in favor of human beings. But resolving the intelligence myth shows us that that first force, machine substitution, is gathering strength. Machines, of course, can’t do everything, but they can do far more, encroaching ever deeper into the realm of tasks performed by human beings. 

2) What’s more, there’s no reason to think that what human beings are currently capable of represents any sort of finishing line, that machines are going to draw to a polite stop once they’re as capable as us. 

Now, none of this matters so long as those helpful winds of complementarity blow firmly enough, but resolving the superiority myth shows us that that process of task encroachment not only strengthens the force of machine substitution, but it wears down those helpful complementarities too. 

Bring these three myths together and I think we can capture a glimpse of that troubling future. Machines continue to become more capable, encroaching ever deeper on tasks performed by human beings, strengthening the force of machine substitution, weakening the force of machine complementarity. And at some point, that balance falls in favor of machines rather than human beings. This is the path we’re currently on. 

**Why is this a ‘good problem to have’?**

**The economic problem** – ” For most of human history, one economic problem has dominated: how to make the economic pie large enough for everyone to live on”. But we have seen over time that as the pie grew bigger, the value of the individual slices have increased. He points out that even if the economic growth is at a measly 1 %, our grandchildren will be twice as rich as us.

  
**Technological Unemployment** – I love this part since he flips over the problem and asks the question we really ought to be asking – “..that success, will have solved one problem — how to make the pie bigger — but replaced it with another — how to make sure that everyone gets a slice”.

**How do we distribute wealth in a world where humans do not work?** ” Today, for most people, their job is their seat at the economic dinner table, and in a world with less work or even without work, it won’t be clear how they get their slice”.

There is so much of discussion around ‘[Universal Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic%5Fincome)“. I have made arguments with friends both for and against this. There have been places this has been tried and tested and failed.

You can read more here about [Finland’s experiment](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/opinion/universal-basic-income-finland.html) with UBI  
And more from Wharton [here](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/universal-basic-income-good-idea)

Also this very interesting story I read about how UBI can backfire that I cant find the link for. Will update when I do

But I digress.

I love the way he summarizes it –

_“Solving this problem is going to require us to think in very different ways. There’s going to be a lot of disagreement about what ought to be done, but it’s important to remember that this is a far better problem to have than the one that haunted our ancestors for centuries: how to make that pie big enough in the first place.”_

So. Again.

**What is the problem we’d rather have?**

> “No matter what job you have in life, your success will be determined 5 percent by your academic credentials, 15 percent by your professional experiences and 80 percent by your communication skills” – Stephen Wang

Unless one were to be living under the rock, it would have been very hard to have missed hearing from [Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony%5FFauci) – director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Disease, who has become the lead spokesperson of the US Coronavirus task force.

Apart from the mammoth task of finding the solution for the current pandemic, scientists across also face another challenge –

##### ‘How to Make Complex Ideas Easy to Understand for Everyone’?

  
Communicating right, especially expert information is a highly relevant skill across all jobs. More so in technology. I have seen data scientists face a ‘_ok, well… so what_‘ quite often.

According to Dr. Fauci’s wife, Christine Grady, his “enduring gift to society” is his ability to make complicated information easy for everyone to understand, from fourth graders to virologists. \[[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2020/04/29/dr-anthony-faucis-gift-for-translating-complex-issues-into-everyday-language/#7c6267cf4a06)\]

What Fauci is doing is taking science communication to a whole new level, experts say. \[[5](https://www.zmescience.com/science/fauci-revolutionizing-communication-09042020/)\]

Here are 7 communication lessons we could all learn from him on how to present complex information 

###### Lesson 1: Translate scientific jargon

Follow up scientific knowledge with what it implies to the audience  
Example – According to Fauci, the international study shows that patients on remdesivir have a ‘faster time to recovery’ than those on a placebo.

What does that mean? “It means the ability to be discharged \[from a hospital\],” according to Fauci. \[[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2020/04/29/dr-anthony-faucis-gift-for-translating-complex-issues-into-everyday-language/#7c6267cf4a06)\]

###### Lesson 2 : Read the room

  
Get to know the audience – who are they and what is important to them. Period. It is more about the audience than the presenter.

###### Lesson 3: Choose the ‘one thing’ you want to leave them with

  
I have been here. When you have done multiple things and want to ensure you show everything you end up showing nothing at all. Do not have a ‘spaghetti bowl’ of information.

Ask the question – **_‘If the audience will remember one thing from the discussion what is that’_**

###### Lesson 4 : Establish Credibility

  
“There is no question Dr. Fauci knows A.LOT. But what makes him even more credible is that he also admits the things he does NOT know.” \[[4](https://www.sunstarstrategic.com/blog/public-relations-blog/item/860-top-communication-tips-from-dr-fauci)\]

###### Lesson 5: Emphasize the big picture

I have learnt this the hard way. We tend to set the context before getting to the conclusion. People want to understand the headline before getting into the details. An effective science communicator cuts through the clutter to extract a short summary of the research.

Faucci summarized the study by saying, “_It proves that a drug can block this virus._” \[[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2020/04/29/dr-anthony-faucis-gift-for-translating-complex-issues-into-everyday-language/#7c6267cf4a06)\]

###### Lesson 6 : Put numbers into perspective

  
There have been a lot of times when data scientists could talk the model performance or the AUC score. What the numbers mean to the business is what is relevant though.

According to the study’s preliminary results, patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery. Fauci acknowledged that, to the average person, 31% doesn’t seem “like a knockout.” But it is significant, he emphasized. \[1\]

###### Lesson 7 : Focus and consistency of the message

  
Identify the message and be disciplined to stick to that. “Dr. Fauci’s ability to stay on message is expert level. It doesn’t matter what news he is delivering that day or what question he is asked, Dr. Fauci sticks to the following four points”: \[[4](https://www.sunstarstrategic.com/blog/public-relations-blog/item/860-top-communication-tips-from-dr-fauci)\]

* Current data shows X
* The models are telling us X
* This is what we don’t know and/or need to find out
* The public should do X

If there’s something that other scientists need to take from this, it’s that when you’re talking to a broader audience, you don’t need to talk like a scientist — you need to talk like a human \[[5](https://www.zmescience.com/science/fauci-revolutionizing-communication-09042020/)\]

  
Scientific discoveries don’t advance on their own. They need skilled communicators to translate the data into everyday language.

**Storytelling expert information and distilling it down to what matters is a key skill.** 

And ‘Anthony Fauci is a role model for how to do it.’ [\[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2020/04/29/dr-anthony-faucis-gift-for-translating-complex-issues-into-everyday-language/#7c6267cf4a06)\]

> “If you can raise somebody’s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise”

Shawn Achor, as per Wiki, is ‘an American happiness researcher, author, and speaker known for his advocacy of positive psychology. He authored The Happiness Advantage and founded GoodThink, Inc’

He is also an enormously gifted orator and a hilarious one at that.

His TEDx speech is rated one of the most popular at 17M + views. I found myself constantly beaming at his acerbic wit. He is the kind of person one would love to be friends with.

Here is a quick summary of what I learnt from his 12 minute TEDx talk on The Happy Secret to Better Work

I remember our toastmaster sessions where the mentor insisted that if there is one thing I ought to pay attention to, it is the ‘Introduction’ to the speech.

This is a section that Shawn gets unerringly accurate. He starts with a story that invokes nostalgia. Childhood. And Siblings.

###### **On defining ‘normal’ from averages** 

The speaker refers to how we see outliers – in statistics and in life. As measurement errors that is messing up our data which ought to be corrected. We are focused on eliminating the weirdos to find the line of the best fit. “If I asked a question like, ‘How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?’, scientists change the answer to ‘How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?’ and we tailor the class towards the average.” But _**normal is merely average**_ _._ That resonates. A lot.

###### **About Positive Psychology**

“Positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Then instead of deleting those positive outliers, what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one. Why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual, athletic, musical ability, creativity, energy levels, resiliency in the face of challenge, sense of humor? Whatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you.” What does this result in? – Potentially moving up our averages on the whole.

###### **What is my reality to yours?** 

A very long time ago when I was in college, I took up this course called Semiotics. If the subject was a person, we’d probably stand on two extreme ends of a football field. For the left-brained, analytical engineer that I was, this was another reason I often questioned myself about why I landed up in a B school that had largely ‘creative’ folks. It is a different thing that those two years transformed me beyond what I ever imagined. What this long-winded tale is about is a pipe. I remember the professor showing us an image of a pipe, titled “Ceci n’est pas une pipe”, French for “This is not a pipe.”

![](https://i0.wp.com/ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MagrittePipe.jpg?resize=300%2C210&ssl=1)

The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed by paralanguage. Compare with Korzybski’s “The word is not the thing” and “The map is not the territory” \[[Wiki Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FTreachery%5Fof%5FImages)\]. 

How is this related to the speech? I recalled this when the speaker spoke about how ‘_**it’s not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality’ .**_ Think about how powerful that is for a moment.![](https://i0.wp.com/thetrifecta.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/300px-MagrittePipe-300x210.jpg?resize=300%2C210)

###### Understanding the science of Happiness 

The usual assumption is that our external world is a predictor of our happiness, “when in reality, if I know everything about your external world, I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness. 90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world”. We focus our efforts on ‘being successful’ in an attempt to find happiness at the other end of the rainbow. But what if we have been looking at this wrong all along.

###### The Myth of the formula for success

“If I work harder, I will be more successful”. I often have this existential questions as to towards what end I am really do what I am doing. The statement is the basis of most of what we do at work and personally. In the way we parent or pursue success. The speaker talks about how that is fallacious since every time we reach our goal post, it moves farther away. We are in fact chasing a unicorn.

###### The happiness advantage 

The speaker concludes that our brains, in fact work in the opposite order. “If you can raise somebody’s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise. In fact, we’ve found that every single business outcome improves. Your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed “

###### How do we reverse the formula

“If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present, then our brains work even more successfully as we’re able to work harder, faster and more intelligently. We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of. Because dopamine, which floods into your system when you’re positive, has two functions. Not only does it make you happier, it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way”

I get all of this. How do I change myself?

The speaker suggests a set of exercises which when done consistently for 21 days or more, can rewire the brain. And by doing this we are training our mind, much like training our bodies to be stronger. And to endure.

##### The 21 day Challenge – 5 Exercises to create Positive Change

1. Gratitudes (emmons and mccullough, 2003)
2. Journaling (slatcher and pennebaker, 2006)
3. Exercise (babyak et all, 2000)
4. Meditation (Dweck, 2007)
5. Random Acts of Kindness (Lyubomirsky,2005)

Book 29/52

Book – [Dip, Seth Godin](https://www.amazon.in/Dip-extraordinary-benefits-knowing-stick/dp/0749928301/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?dchild=1&keywords=Dip&qid=1596630100&s=books&sr=1-3)

**_“If you are not going to get to #1, you may as well quit now”_**

_**“Average is for losers”**_

Never quit, he says is bad advice. Winners quit all the time – they just quit the right stuff at the right time.   
Most people quit – just that they don’t quite successfully. In fact, he says many market places works on the presumption that you will quit. Airlines oversold their flights because they knew they’d profit from the no-shows.

Losers, on the other hand, fall into two basic traps. Either they fail to stick out the Dip – they get to the moment of truth and then give up – or they never even find the right Dip to conquer.

Dip is the long slog between starting and mastery – between beginner’s luck and real accomplishment.

Extraordinary benefits that accrue to the tiny minority who are able to push through just a tiny bit longer than most. Also to the tiny majority who have the guts to quit early and refocus efforts on what matters.

Being best in the world is seriously underrated – the rewards are highly skewed towards the winner. The reason number one matters? People do not have lot of time and don’t want to take lot of risks. If you are diagnosed with cancer, you’d want to go to the ‘top doctor’ – everyone prefers the top choice in the niche.   
Anyone who is going to hire you, buy from you, recommend you, vote for you or do what you want them to do is going to wonder if you’re the best choice. Best as in – best for them, right now, based on what they believe in and what they know.

The next time you catch yourself being average when you feel like quitting, realize that you have only two good choices – Quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers.

The decision to quit or not is a simple evaluation – is the pain of the dip worth the benefit of the light at the end of the tunnel.

  
This is from a very short book called ‘Dip by Seth Godin’ about a very relevant topic – quitting. A great strategy to manage your life and career.

Bottomline – to quote

**“Quit the wrong stuff. Stick with the right stuff. Have the guts to do one or the other”**

Should I resign from this job or not? Vs.  
What do I enjoy doing for my career and how do I get to it?

Today at PODSHORTS, we’ll talk about one of the villains of decision making – Avoiding a narrow frame

A researcher named Rook Fischoff wanted to understand more about the teenage decision making process – so he and his colleagues interviewed teenagers

Most of us think of decisions are one where we need to choose from 2 or more options – ‘Should we eat at Chipotle or Subway’. Which color shirt should we buy – navy, blue or black?

The teenagers decisions rarely had the structure – most common type was one that lacked any choice at all – one he called ‘a statement of resolve’. An example would be – “I am going to stop blaming others’.  
In other examples, teens assessed a single option – ‘I am deciding whether or not to breakup with my boyfriend’

The authors refer to these as ‘Whether or not’ decisions. It isn’t a decision between multiple options, it is simply an up or down vote on a single alternative.

These two categories **– statements of resolve and whether or not decisions composed 65% of teenagers decisions.**

As it turns out when it comes to making decisions, some organizations are a lot like teenagers.

The authors calls out a study where of the teams he studies, only 29% considered more than one alternative.

Whether or Not decisions failed 52% of the time in the long term vs only 32% decisions with two or more alternatives

Why do whether or not decisions fail more often?

When a manager pursues a single option – she spends time asking – how can I make this work?

How can I get my colleagues behind me? Meanwhile, other vital options get neglected. Is there a better way? What else can we do?

Widen your options. Can we broaden a narrow frame and discover better options for ourselves?  
Next time you hear yourself ask a whether/not decision – step back and reevaluate your options.   
A way to break out of narrow frame – is to use an opportunity cost question. What else can we do with the same time and resources?

“I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife’s grave. Then I joined the army. Visiting Kathy’s grave was the less dramatic of the two.”

I have such a fun series of 3 books lined up for review today – from my favorite genre, Sci Fi.

Old Man’s War series is a set of 6 sci fi novels by John Scalzi – one that is so gripping that I listened to the first three of the series back to back on Audible

The first three novels are Old Man’s War, Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony.

Such a joy ride this was!

Lets’ start with the first one – Old Man’s war.  
The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce– and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate.

Earth isn’t the centre of humanity -which is kept in ignorance whilst providing a constant supply of soldiers \[which are essentially older people who are given new bodies\] by the Colonial Defence Forces .

I liked this book the best of the series. For a book published in 2005, it really does do a fabulous job in envisioning transfer of conscious and questioning what identity means. It introduces the concept of time dilation and use of ‘brain pals’ to communicate – one that eerily sounds akin to the brain machine interfaces that Elon’s company Neuralink is working towards.

“What is it like when you lose someone you love?” Jane asked.  
“You die, too. And you wait around for your body to catch up.”

  
The second book – Ghost Brigades is probably my least favorite of the three and yet I loved the protagonist, Jared Dirac. When the first had old people signing up to go out into the galaxy to fight in the alien war, the second book focuses on Special forces of the CDF.  
The elite soldiers – perfect for fighting alien races are created from the DNA of the dead humans. Imagine being born into an adult body and unravelling experiences over time with help from your brain pal. Being integrated with your unit to feel and hear everything they do. They are fast, strong, green and socially inept.   
Jared Dirac is the super human hybrid created from that of humanity’s greater traitor – Boutin, the scientist who has joined enemy alien forces and knows CDFs biggest secrets.

It is interesting how each of the alien races is described – from the Oben to the Consu beyond just the physical characteristics which is what most movies focus on.

Here is a quote.  
Fear isn’t the desire to avoid death or pain. Fear is rooted in the knowledge that what you recognize as yourself can cease to exist. Fear is existential.”

  
Finally, the third book of the series – The Last colony, now circles back to John Perry and his wife from the Special forces, Carl Sagan who have been recalled from their life of tranquillity and retirement as leaders of a new colony, Roanoke – to be populated by settlers across major human worlds. Focused on the life of settlers in the new colony at large in the first half, the half soon spirals into full blown war between the worlds. How does Perry protect his family and the colony with the limited information CDF has been providing them without turning traitorous.

Scalzi brings in humor – a dry kind across his books.

“I seem to be good at speaking the politicians’ language,” Szilard said. “Apparently there’s an advantage around here to being mildly socially retarded, and that’s the Special Forces for sure.”

From <https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/18279847-the-last-colony>

  
I wonder what makes a good sci-fi – and it struck me it is mostly two things.

One the journey into the future that the author manages to take us into – exploring thought experiments \[ what is we lived in a world where consciousness is transferable, what happens if there is centralized control of our thoughts aka, Black Mirror\]. The other is the fact that across all of those experiments, it retains the characterization and what it essentially means for us to be human.

Do pick up the books and also let me know other sci-fi books you have absolutely enjoyed!

Book 30/52

Book – [Decisive, Chip and Dan Heath](https://www.amazon.in/Decisive-Chip-Heath/dp/1847940862/ref=sr%5F1%5F2?dchild=1&keywords=decisive&qid=1596628404&sr=8-2)

**_“Always ooch before you leap!”_**

Think about a student, Steve who has decided to go to pharmacy school. He thinks he likes working in healthcare and he enjoys chemistry. This is thin evidence for such an important decision. He is placing a huge bet with paltry information -. An obvious decision would be to work in a pharmacy for free to get the job for a few days to understand what it entails and how he takes to it – this calls for ‘ooching’. Imagine spending 2-3 years studying and then startign a career that never suited you.

  
The concept of Ooching refers to constructing small experiments to test out one’s hypothesis.  
Rather than choosing ‘all’ or ‘nothing’ – we choose a ‘little something’. When we ooch, we bring in real-world experience into our decision

For business executives this translates to firing bullets, then cannon balls – i.e, run small experiments and then doubling down on ones that work best!

So Why then is ooching not more instinctive?  
The reason it isnt is because – we are awfully confident about our predictions. The ‘I just know in my gut’ attitude is in all of us to bother with ooching since we think we know how things will unfold.

In a study, Phil Tetlock studied 284 experts he found that experts predictions was worse off than a crude extrapolation algorithm.  
Ooching provides an alternative – a way of discovering reality than predicting it

If you’re thinking of moving to a new city, maybe first try working remotely for a month in that city.   
Thinking about becoming an Datascientist – spending time working on real business problems and getting your hands dirty with data might be a worthwhile exercise for you to test your assumptions that this is the next career for you.

Whenever possible, we should ooch, conducting small experiments to teach us more – why do you need to predict when you can know?

This concept is again from the Book – Decisive, Chip and Dan Heath.

“Always ooch before you leap!”

Genre – NonFiction – Memoir

Book 17/52

Book – [The Choice – Embrace the possible](https://www.amazon.in/Choice-true-story-hope/dp/1846045126/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=2P04162M5NHC3&dchild=1&keywords=the+choice+edith+eger&qid=1596557047&s=books&sprefix=the+cho%2Cstripbooks%2C287&sr=1-1)

This can be a life changing read – this beautifully written memoir is not just fitting for the time we are in today but personally has been helpful in releasing the pent up anger and frustration I have subjected myself to.

Its 1944 and a 16 year old ballerina is sent to Auswichz along with her sister and her parents. She inadvertently sends her mother to her death and watches her literally go up in flames. She doesn’t get to say goodbye to her father. She ends up dancing for the infamous Dr Mengele and eventually is pulled out from among a bunch of dead bodies, presumed to dead. She not just survives to tell the tale but goes back to Auswichz decades later, now a trained psychologist herself to find closure, for not to forgive is to hold oneself hostage to the past.

The book I am talking about is “The Choice – Embrace the possible” – Dr Edith Eva Eger

“What happened can never be forgotten and never be changed but over time I learnt, I can choose, how I can respond to the past. I can be miserable or I can be hopeful. I can be depressed or I can be happy. We always have that choice” I am here. This is now.

Such an incredibly uplifting book this – the only other book I cried for was Book thief. If you are looking at making peace with yourself and understand what is happening currently in the world around us- do yourself a favor and please get a copy.

“The truth is we will have unpleasant experiences in our life. We will make mistakes – we won’t always get what we want – this is part of being human. The problem and the foundation of our persistent suffering is the belief that discomfort, mistakes, disappointment signal something about our worth – the belief that unpleasant things in our life is all we deserve”

In the first section of the book, Dr Edith talks about her childhood, her dreams of making the Olympic team at Ballet and her juvenile love – one that probably let us stay afloat. She watches everything she has known in life disappear almost overnight.

But she is resilient –

“To be passive is to let others decide for you. To be aggressive is to decide for others. To be assertive is to decide for yourself. And to trust that there is enough, that you are enough.”

She survives as she lives for the sister that accompanies are, drawing strength from each other

As she moves to the second part, Dr Edith has physically gotten away from Auschiwz but even as she marries, moves to US and has kids, she continues to fight the battles in her head.

The narrative comes a complete circle when she finally finds herself back to where it all started to exorcise the ghosts of her own past

“She quotes Carl Rogers – ‘when we come to believe that there is no way to be loved and be genuine, we risk denying our true nature. Self acceptance is the hardest part of healing”

In conclusion, Dr Edith, now an eminent psychologist talks about her patients and their struggles with acceptance. In guilt she still tries to overcome about not lying when she was asked in the ‘selection line’, if the lady next to her was her mother or sister. In speaking the truth, she sent her to her death – a fact that continues to haunt her. As she narrated the story of the couple who lost their teen son – the ‘what-if’ questions that continued to haunt them – it found resonance in this feeling I have been trying to look away from. With the hope that maybe if I don’t think about it long enough – it might go away. The fact that I constantly question my decisions that might have probably saved my dad – or even given me a chance to say good bye.

“When we don’t give ourselves a chance to grieve, we are doomed to constantly reliving them”

It is also a fitting reminder of the times we live in.

“Edith wonders as she passes a group of young men – ‘ has my generation taught the youth well to prevent another holocaust from occurring. Or will our hard earned freedom capsize into a new sea of hate”

She says ,’Find the bigot in you. Find the part in you that is judging – assigning labels – diminishing another humanity, making others less than who they are”.

We all have a choice. The choice to accept myself as I am – human and imperfect. I have the choice to be responsible for my own happiness. I can’t ever chance the past – but there is a life I can save – it is mine. The one I am living right now.

“Time doesn’t heal. It’s what you do with time. Healing is possible when we choose to take responsibility, when we choose to take risks, and finally, when we choose to release the wound, to let go of the past or the grief”.

Genre – NonFiction – Memoir

Book 16/52

Book – [I can’t make this up, Kevin Hart](https://www.amazon.in/Cant-Make-This-Up-Lessons/dp/1501155563/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=1GGI4ZFHS9MNJ&dchild=1&keywords=i+cant+make+this+up+kevin+hart&qid=1596553509&s=books&sprefix=I+cant+make+this+%2Cstripbooks%2C287&sr=1-1)

I had zero interest in this book when I picked it up on an audible recommendation.

I haven’t really heard of Kevin Hart. Or seen his comedy. As the cost of sounding snobbish, my previous three memoirs are Educated by Tara WestOver, Becoming by Michelle Obama and Shoe Dog by Phil Knight.

But. BUT  
I didn’t expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Post this 12 hour, 99 chapter soliloquy, I felt like I knew the man behind the memoir. Kevin Hart. Superstar American comedian and Hollywood box office star Kevin Hart turns shares like life lessons in this hilarious, endearing memoir – ‘I can’t make this up’.   
I almost miss listening to him each morning now – it almost feels like I know the person.

Hart is so imperfectly perfect. One cant read this book – you ought to listen to him on Audible. He doesn’t just narrate the story of his life but he has conversations with you like you were in the room with him.

He talks about how it took him only 16 years to become an ‘overnight success.’ In this inspirational and entertaining memoir – Hart talks about his life, career, family, and friends – a journey from the broken family – the trope of a drug addicted dad and raised by a mother who sacrificed a lot in her life to raise her two boys.. It was poignant to walk through the journey of Hart who grows up from being a Shoe salesman wanting to be a Nike rep one day to partner with Nike to create his own products a decade later.

It just takes one person to say one thing, and your whole life can change. If success happens in part by chance, then the more you expose yourself to it, the luckier you will be. I worked hard in order to get lucky. It may seem to others like it is a smooth trajectory upwards, but Hart outlines every pivotal step in his career that is relevant to any one seeking success.

He talks of how he had to choose between the ‘uncomfortable dictatorship’ of his moms’ home to the ‘comfortable anarchy’ that was his dad. About how the discipline and values his mom instilled in his stood with his trysts with failure.

I’ve learned so many valuable lessons in my life, and this was one of the most important: Do your best, always. Because you never know who’s watching.

The volume is peppered by life incidents that are hilarious and of the ‘does this even happen’ kinds. If there are critical life skills one could pick out resonating across the entire volume it is probably his positive attitude’ or what he calls, ‘the shoulder shrug’ – his ability to see the big picture and not complain or hold onto negative emotions.

  
It’s easy to complain about your life—how tough it is, how unfair it is, how stressful it is, how everyone else has it much better. But if you step into the life of someone you envy for just a day, you’ll discover that everyone has their own problems, and they’re usually worse than yours. Because your problems are designed specifically for you, with the specific purpose of helping you grow.

Here is a funny incident from the book

– When he was financially strapped early in his career, Kevin maxed out an American Express card…..and couldn’t pay the bill. The company never forgot, and – even when Kevin was a huge success – denied him a card. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin writes: “American Express, if you’re reading this, please run my credit again. I wrote this entire book just to send a message to you: I’m now ready to handle the responsibility of a credit card.”

It is a roller coaster ride – of lessons one can learn – of failed marriages from committing before you are ready, of grit in the face of disaster, constant learning and faith in self, of winning and then losing it all, of listening to yourself and if you are still unsure – ask a mentor.

This may not be revolutionary. Or philosophical, Or Behavioral economics. Or anything like the other books I read. But nonetheless, it is a book by a doer.

And like he concludes –   
Success is not an excuse to stop; it’s a reason to move the goalposts farther out and accelerate. There is no destination, just a journey. And that journey is to keep building on top of what I’m building.  
  
And I am glad I listened to this.

Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small.”

Today we review Marcus Aurelius’ stoic classic, “Meditations”.

The Roman emperor and philosopher documents the one of its kind, advice to self that is relevant across times…

It offers a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe.

Book – [The End of Epidemics: The Looming Threat to Humanity and How to Stop It ](https://www.amazon.in/End-Epidemics-Looming-Threat-Humanity/dp/1250117771)

“When 2 year old Emilie grabbed and poked a dead bat from a tree, a few particles of blood landed on his hands, and as toddlers do, he put his fingers in his mouth. Soon after, he grew agonizingly ill… “

The 2018 written book, talks about how Epidemics pose a looking threat to humanity.

He calls out seven set of concrete steps to stop killer viruses from destroying millions of lives. A new pandemic he states could kill more than 300 million people and reduce global GDP by 5 to 10 percent.

He talks of how deforestation, climate change and population movement are turning wildlife into pandemic incubators and lessons learnt from SARS, Zika and Ebola. “The equivalent of just 1 USD per year per person on the planet (around 7.5 billion annually) will save lives and pay for itself in lower emergency costs and reduced economic disruption’, he stated. He also talks about how the ‘global food industry is failing to safeguard people from microbes such as viruses that cause influenza’

A book that aims at making the world safer from infectious outbreaks.

The time to have read it was in 2018.

The next best is now.

“Station 11”, is a dystopian novel that is set in the days of civilization’s collapse after a pandemic has devastated the world.

Paper – [The folly of rewarding for behavior A while hoping for behavior B](https://lnkd.in/frtbYip)

Rewarding for A while hoping for B

Today we are going to talk about a management classic paper – Rewarding for behavior A while expecting behavior B.

Something that is highly relevant to us as we set goals for ourselves and our teams – we’ll look at it using an actual real life story. The famous story related to Australia which began as a prison colony for England…

“Whether dealing with monkeys, rats, or human beings, it is hardly controversial to state that most organisms seek information concerning what activities are rewarded, and then seek to do (or at least pretend to do) those things, often to the virtual exclusion of activities not rewarded.

Nevertheless, numerous examples exist of reward systems that are fouled up in that the types of behavior rewarded are those which the rewarder is trying to discourage, while the behavior desired is not being rewarded at all”

Why we sleep?

Do yourself a favor and read the book – 3 things you absolutely should know about how sleep impacts your life

The impact of sleep neglect on health, what happens when we sleep and effect of sleep deprivation on emotional health and weight gain.

The book we are going to review today is already my favorite book of the year and I have 45 odd to go – I highly recommend you read this or at the least spare 5 minutes and you’d understand why the evolutionary process didn’t evolve to eliminate sleep.

Why, though seemingly time-wasting/unproductive, we still need to get a good night’s sleep to get a long list of physiological, biological, psychological benefits

Should we give Super Intelligent AI, goals, and if so, whose goals? 

 “Life 3.0 – Being human in the age of Artificial Intelligence” – Max Tegmark

The single most thorniest topic in AI, as the author states is ‘goals’.

Should we be giving AI goals? How can we do this? How do we ensure the AI when it moves from being sub human to super human in intelligence retains these goals? What happens if the goals of an AI system do not align with ours? This is a fascinating read that will change the way we think about AI, Super Intelligence, singularity and most importantly, the future of humanity.

Book – [10% Human, Allana Collen](https://www.amazon.in/10-Human-Microbes-Health-Happiness-ebook/dp/B00O0FY5TI)

How your body’s microbes may have a relationship to obesity, allergies and your overall health and happiness  

Research that explores the connection that the microbial community that lives within us has on our overall health and well-being. 

There were such moments of epiphany while reading this. “… how about the concept of a personality composed by the bacteria living in your gut? 

Mice without gut microbes are antisocial, preferring to spend time alone rather than with other mice. Whereas a mouse with a normal microbiota will choose to meet and greet any new mice added to its cage, germ-free mice stick with mice they already know. 

Simply having gut microbes seems to make them more friendly” Fun Fact – Apologies for the abrupt ending, am still learning to edit. Here is the quote referenced – “even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.”

##### Recent years progress in artificial intelligence has prompted renewed interest in a question posed by Russell and Norvig : What if we succeed?

![Technological Singularity Source: Kurzweil 2006 ](https://i0.wp.com/ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Technological-Singularity-Source-Kurzweil-2006.png?resize=850%2C420&ssl=1)

Technological Singularity Source: Kurzweil 2006

If and when AI researchers succeed at the goal of designing machines with cross-domain learning and decision-making capabilities that rival those of humans, the consequences for science, technology, and human life are likely to be large.

> **What if we get to the point of Superintelligence where machines are better and smarter than us?**

I find a lot of cognitive dissonance in getting myself to accept the concept of singularity and the potential backlashes that may follow.

There are a bunch of companies and individuals who aren’t just asking these questions but going ahead in working in creating systems and checks in place to ensure the future isn’t science fiction we did not plan for.

This is really good paper I came across on [Alignment Machine Learning](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf) and it attempts to understand and expound on these thought.

**Complete article content credit to the authors of the paper.**

Russell talks about the potential that a system’s objective function _– may not be perfectly aligned with the values of the human race, which are (at best) very difficult to pin down;_ 

Any sufficiently capable intelligent system will prefer to ensure its own continued existence and to acquire physical and computational resources not for their own sake, but to succeed in its assigned task.

What really is the motivation for such research – In the long run, as ML and AI gain capabilities, humans will continue to place trust on these systems to make larger decisions. It becomes critically important thus that they act in accordance with the intentions of the operators and without posing a threat to the society at large.

Imagine designing a cure for Parkinson’s ‘_without doing anything drastic_‘. Teaching a kid what is ‘drastic’ is a learnt behavior. How do we translate this into machines?

> _Also, one of the key attractions of learning systems is that they can find clever ways to meet objectives that the programmers might not have thought of. It is thus a ‘feature’ of learning and not a ‘bug’._

‘Consider the challenge of designing robust objective functions for learning systems that are capable of representing facts about their programmers beliefs and desires. If the programmers learn that the systems objective function is mis-specified, then they will want to repair this defect. If the learner is aware of this fact, however, then it has a natural incentive to conceal any defects in its objective function, for the systems current objectives are unlikely to be achieved if the system is made to pursue different objectives.’

##### **How does this translate technically ? In trying to create what I am going to term as ‘safe AI’? There are two types of research that might help in this.** 

1. ##### **Research that makes it easier to specify our intended goals as ‘objective functions**
2. ##### **Research to design AI systems that avoid side effects and negative incentives even if the objective function is not completely met.**

As per this paper, Soares and Fallenstein (2014) refer to the former approach as _value specification_, and the latter as _error tolerance_.

This paper highlights 8 of these research areas based on these two approaches. A lot of companies in the ML community are currently working in this area. \[Ref – [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)\]

Some of these areas are based on value specification, some on error tolerance and some others on both. Also, there is a pre-requisite that the solutions that are proposed need to be applicable even in ML systems that are more capable than the ones that exist today.

Which implies that solutions that depend on the system’s ignorance of a certain fact discover able in the future or assumption of its inability to come up with a particular strategy would be unsatisfactory in the long run.

What are these 8 research areas?

#### **1\] Inductive ambiguity identification :** How can we train ML systems to detect and notify us of cases where the classification of test data is highly under-determined from the training data

### _“There is a need to build systems that keep humans ‘in the loop’ and recognize when they are (or aren’t) too inexperienced to make a critical decision”_

Consider a classic parable recounted by Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1992): The US army once built a neural network intended to distinguish between Soviet tanks and American tanks. The system performed remarkably well with relatively little training data so well, in fact, that researchers grew suspicious.

Upon inspection, they found that all of the images of Soviet tanks were taken on a sunny day, while the images of US tanks were taken on a cloudy day. The network was discriminating between images based on their brightness, rather than based on the variety of tank depicted. It is to be expected that a classifier, given training data, will identify very simple boundaries (such as brightness) that separate the data.

However, what we want is a classifier that can, given a data set analogous to the tank training set, recognize that it does not contain any examples of Soviet tanks on cloudy days, and ask the user for clarification. Doing so would likely require larger training sets and different training techniques. The problem of inductive ambiguity identification is to develop robust techniques for automatically identifying this sort of ambiguity and querying the user only when necessary

#### **2\] Robust human imitation**: How can we design and train ML systems to effectively imitate humans who are engaged in complex and difficult tasks?

* We essentially want the system to ‘consult a human operator for advice’ without actually providing that as a general purpose objective function.
* The high-level question here is: Can we define a measurable objective function for human imitation such that the better a system correctly imitates a human, the better its score according to this objective function?

#### **3\] Informed oversight**: How can we train a reinforcement learning system to take actions that aid an intelligent overseer, such as a human, in accurately assessing the systems performance?

* Consider an ML system trained to write original novels, using a corpus of human novels as training data. It might be quite a bit less intelligent than a human (according to many different intelligence metrics), but the human may still have a fair bit of trouble accurately evaluating the systems performance. For instance, it might be easy for the system to simply plagiarize a novel, and it might be hard for a human to check whether the novel was in fact plagiarized. (Perhaps the system used a simple rewriting scheme to make the plagiarism difficult to detect by a text search, but still easy to detect for a human comparing the novels side-by-side.) How do we make it easy for the human to assess the performance of an advanced ML system pursuing some particular task?

##### TL;DR – How can we train systems to not only take good actions, but take actions that can be accurately assessed by overseers?

#### **4\] Generalizable environmental goals**: How can we create systems that robustly pursue goals defined in terms of the state of the environment, rather than defined directly in terms of their sensory data?

* Many ML systems have their objectives specified in terms of their sensory data. For example, reinforcement learners have the objective of maximizing discounted reward over time where reward and/or loss are part of the systems precepts.
* While these sensory goals can be useful proxies for environmental goals, environmental goals are distinct: Tricking your sensors into perceiving that a sandwich is in the room is not the same as actually having a sandwich in the room

#### **5\] Conservative concepts**: How can a classifier be trained to develop useful concepts that exclude highly atypical examples and edge cases?

* Many of the concerns raised by Russell (2014) and Bostrom (2014) center on cases where an AI system optimizes some objective, and, in doing so, finds a strange and undesirable edge case.
* For example, if we task an AI system with creating screwdrivers, by showing it 10,000 examples of screwdrivers and 10,000 examples of non-screwdrivers, we might want it to create a pretty average screwdriver as opposed to, say, an extremely tiny screwdriver even though tiny screwdrivers may be cheaper and easier to produce.

#### **6\] Impact measures:** What sorts of regularizers incentivize a system to pursue its goals with minimal side effects?

* We would prefer a highly intelligent AI system to avoid creating large unintended side effects in pursuit of its objectives, and also to notify us of any large impacts that might result from achieving its goal. For example, if we ask it to build a house for a homeless family, it should know implicitly that it should avoid destroying nearby houses for materials a large side effect.

#### **7\] Mild optimization**: How can we design systems that pursue their goals without trying too hard, i.e., stopping when the goal has been pretty well achieved, as opposed to expending further resources searching for ways to achieve the absolute optimum expected score?

* Many of the concerns discussed by Bostrom (2014) in the book [Superintelligence ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence)describe cases where an advanced AI system is maximizing an objective as hard as possible
* Perhaps the system was instructed to make only 1000 paperclips, and it uses every resource at its disposal and every trick it can come up with to make sure that it definitely made 1000 paperclips (and that its sensors didn’t have any faults)
* The problem of mild optimization is: how can we design AI systems and objective functions that, in this intuitive sense, don’t optimize more than they have to?

#### **8\] Averting instrumental incentives:** How can we design and train systems such that they robustly lack default incentives to manipulate and deceive the operators, compete for scarce resources, etc?

* This is the use-case that science fiction is made of. The apocalyptic ones at that. For example, if the system is rewarded for shutting down when the humans want it to shut down, then the system has incentives to take actions that make the humans want to shut it down
* A system that believes that the operators (and only the operators) possess knowledge of the right objective function might be very careful in how it deals with the operators, and this caution could counteract potentially harmful default incentives

Let us just consider one of them to understand the complication and need for designing such systems. These are traits that are inherent in humans. Learnt behavior that my 2.5 year old has probably already picked up from us.

Mild optimization: How can we design systems that pursue their goals without trying too hard, i.e., stopping when the goal has been pretty well achieved, as opposed to expending further resources searching for ways to achieve the absolute optimum expected score?

We know perfect is the enemy of good. We as people probably have different radius’ in terms of how long we continue to persist on a activity in alignment with the ROI it brings in. There is clearly a dial in our heads that tells us when and where to stop. The word is [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing).

There is clearly a lot of work that is currently happening in each of these areas. Something I hope to cover in part 2 of this post.

##### The larger question remains – How do we teach a machine to learn traits that is so critically important in what makes us, us.

One lazy evening, sitting by the window, I was thinking about the diplomatic, contentious statements we tend to hear all the time. Things like this –

* Money doesn’t buy happiness
* People don’t judge you based on Race (or if you are an Indian, insert ‘caste’)
* Looks don’t matter
* Parents don’t ever play favorites among their kids
* All mothers are good mothers
* Working harder every day will make you successful….. et all

I think all of them are largely true. With caveats though.

[Michael Norton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%5FNorton%5F%28professor%29) is a social science researcher, TEDx speaker and professor of business administration at Harvard Business School.

Here is an excerpt from his TEDx speech on ‘How to buy Happiness’

Can money buy love? No.

Can money buy happiness? It can, oddly enough.

How can money buy happiness?

A lot of us spend a lot of time thinking about how we can earn both – money and happiness. As per new research, if we think we can’t buy happiness it is maybe because we are spending it wrong.On how we spend our money – Let us talk about the ways in which we are spending it that is wrong? On material goods and stuff we can do without, maybe. 

What happens to people when they win a lottery? Paradoxically, as per research their lives are ruined. Most of them spend it and go into debt quite soon. In the process they also lose friends who nag them for newly earned money.

As per a[ research](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/dunn%20aknin%20norton.pdf) by Prof Norton, what people did with the money makes a lot of difference to their levels of happiness. The researchers gave two groups of people envelopes filled with money in them with the criteria that they were to spend it by 5 pm that evening. The difference being that one group were to spend the money on self and the second on others. For those who were to spend it on oneself, it was business as usual. They mostly got something like makeup or coffee. The second group though had a disruption – they deliberated over how to spend the money. This was a change in pattern of thinking. They eventually spend it on the homeless and on others. The second group thought about and used money differently from how they usually do. The groups were measured on a happiness scale between 1-10 before and after the experiment. It always turned out that those who spent it on others had a significantly higher positive effect on happiness than those who didn’t. The results held true irrespective of whether this was in Uganda or Canada.

Broadly thus, I think the psychological research tallies with what we can intuitively grasp

1. Money IS important to happiness UNTIL one’s basic needs and security is met. After a certain threshold (which may vary based on demographics), the positive net effects of money may be offset by negative effects in trying or working to maintain that lifestyle
2. Doing makes us happier than Having. I keep reading about articles where ‘experiences’ are always better than spending on material goods. I find it EXTREMELY difficult to get my brain to accept the fact that the savvy new Banana Republic coat or Bobbi Brown lip gloss doesn’t make me as happy as a trip to the beach. But the only cogent explanation I can come up with is that it fails rule 1 in not crossing my ‘threshold’
3. Spending money on others makes us feel good about ourselves. I’d accede.

While _money_ can’t buy happiness, it certainly lets you choose your own form of misery.

I think I’d leave you with that thought by Groucho Marx and this Beatles song.

Adieu!

I rarely re-read books. 

One exception to that rule is [Marcus Aurelius – Meditations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations). 

I find myself going back to it every time I waver or each time I am unsure of the path that I am following. It was a private notebook of sorts – not one intending to be published but it offers a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe

There are three primary names one comes across in this school of Philosophy – [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus%5FAurelius), [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus) and [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca%5Fthe%5FYounger).

One of the chapters from the book starts with this quote 

> _When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own – not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural._
> 
> Marcus Aurelius

Something that takes a lot of effort for me to focus on, sure. But steadfast nonetheless. Marcus is one of the well known Stoics. One who followed the philosophy of Stoicism. It reminds me of Buddhism and the idea of mindfulness, but then I am neither a philosopher nor an historian to comment.

So this is the Wiki definition of Stoicism –

**Stoicism** is a school of [Hellenistic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic%5Fphilosophy) that flourished throughout the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient%5FRome) and [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%5FGreece) world until the 3rd century AD. Stoicism is predominantly a **philosophy of personal ethics** which is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world.

According to its teachings, _as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting this moment as it presents itself, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner._

People aren’t born Stoics. But there are amidst us those who face hurdles with equanimity and lucidity.

Stoicism has a few basic tenets –

* The world at large is unpredictable. \[I’d add, so are people\]
* Our life in this world is extremely brief \[ I am always reminded of this image of the galaxy and the time line of evolution of life visually to show how very insignificant my life is in the larger scheme of things\]
* How can one be steadfast and strong – and in control of yourself, at all times.
* And finally, that the source of our dissatisfaction lies within us. In the impulsiveness of our reflexive senses rather than logic.
* The focus, thence, is on overcoming destructive emotions and act on that which can be acted upon.
* Stoicism, most importantly, differs from most existing schools in one important sense: its purpose is practical application. It is not a purely intellectual enterprise.

This would probably be a modern day super power if only I can find a way for assimilating it. Maybe I should take an [MooC on Philosophy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy#syllabus)

Stoics practiced what are termed ‘spiritual exercises’ \[to develop their stoic muscle?\] I must revisit these exercises or better still practice them on a 21 day sprint.

1. **Practice Misfortune** –_It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself for difficult times; while fortune is bestowing favors on it is then is the time for it to be strengthened against her rebuffs_ \-Seneca. The goal being to put oneself in face of the want and ask yourself, ‘Is this what you used to dread’. The point thus is not to ‘think about’ the misfortune but to live it. Emotions are rooted on anxiety and fear of uncertainty and rarely based on past experience. Maybe the reality is something we can handle, after all. **Practice what you fear, whether a simulation in your mind or in real life. The downside is almost always reversible or transient.**
2. **Train Perception to avoid the good and bad** – _Choose not to be harmed and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed and you haven’t been -Marcus Aurelius._ The Stoics had an exercise called Turning the Obstacle Upside Down. What they meant to do was make it impossible to not practice the art of philosophy. Because if you can properly turn a problem upside down, every action becomes a new source of good. To a stoic, thus, everything is an opportunity. ‘_There is no good or bad to the practicing Stoic. There is only perception. You control perception. You can choose to extrapolate past your first impression . If you tie your first response to dispassion, you’ll find that everything is simply an opportunity’_. Suppose I am being face by a surly friend whom I have been very patient with but they are being extremely morose and ungrateful. Instead of making your life more difficult, the exercise says, they’re actually directing you towards new virtues; for example, patience or understanding. Now that is going to be a really tedious thing to do. I am going to have to try.
3. **Remembering that is all ephemeral** – _Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both. -Marcus Aurelius_. Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself a simple and effective reminder to help him regain perspective and stay balanced:R_un down the list of those who felt intense anger at something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the most whatever: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend or not even a legend. Think of all the examples. And how trivial the things we want so passionately are._  I think this again points back to reminding oneself of ‘how small and insignificant we are’ and so are our actions. The immediate question thus is if everything is insignificant- achievements or sadness, what really matters? What matters is right now. This moment. And doing the right thing, right now.
4. **Look at things from the birds-eye view –** How beautifully Plato put it. Whenever you want to talk about people, it’s best to take a bird’s- eye view and see everything all at once” of gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign people, holidays, memorials, markets” all blended together and arranged in a pairing of opposites. [Marcus Aurelius.](https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius/) Step back, zoom out and look at life and what it offers from a larger vantage point. Despite how difficult that seems to sound in implementing, I believe this helps figure out the trivial from the important. In the larger scheme of things, worrying about a deck that is due or a model that I need to re-work probably isn’t too high up in my life. **Take Plato’s View**
5. **Memento Mori – Meditate on your mortality** :_Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day. The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time. [Seneca.](https://dailystoic.com/Seneca)_ In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius wrote that _You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. That was a personal reminder to continue living a life of virtue now, and not wait._ This makes me weepy for some weird reason. \[Note to self – Read Seneca’s biography – ‘[Dying Every Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077789-dying-every-day)‘\]. I think though that constant reminders of the transient nature of our lives serves well in living life to the fullest each day as the last one.
6. **Is this something that I can control?** – _The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own . . ._ [Epictetus](https://www.dailystoic.com/Epictetus). I cannot understate the significance of this. If only I can return to this each day. No matter how hard i try, I cannot change certain situations or people. I think this is one thing I need to focus as part of my journal each day and reflect on constantly. Focus on what I can change, what I cant and the sense to differentiate between them.
7. **Journal** – This is one of the biggest gifts I might have given myself this year. Most of the times, my brain is a muddle of thoughts and questions. Things I may not necessarily voice out to another person. Journal ling helps in not only voicing out my concerns and happiness but in providing clarity behind emotions. I feel sad is an emotion. Journal ling provides the much needed self examination. Sometimes we just want to tell someone what we are going through. And that someone doesn’t have to be another person.
8. **Practice negative visualization** Again, I find this extremely distressing right now. It is imagining things that can potentially go wrong or be taken away from us. Reminds me of the first exercise in that sense. ‘We do not get what is rightfully ours, even if we have earned it’ .![](https://i0.wp.com/thetrifecta.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/7174d86d0b30afefc08923ee8cdc58c0-214x300.jpg?resize=214%2C300)

We hear about the term Block chain way too often to ignore it any more. And more often that not, it is referred to with negative connotations sans basis. 

![](https://i0.wp.com/ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how_to_start_a_career_in_blockchain_technology.jpg?resize=848%2C477&ssl=1)

And no I am not just talking about it in relation to Bitcoins or Cryptocurrency. I am referring to the technology driving Bitcoins – Blockchain.

Blockchain as a technology is so disruptive that it could potentially revolutionize the world economy says this [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/how-blockchains-could-change-the-world) report. Before we get to the why, we will look at the what. [Naval Ravikant](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/naval-ravikant#section-overview) is a lot of things I admire but most importantly, he is such a great thinker and this [36 tweet storm](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/877467629308395521.html) mostly summarizes how the world as we know of it could change.

This article is a quick primer on what one needs to know about Blockchain. How does it work? And lastly, what are the practical applications beyond Bitcoins?

I am going to haphazard a guess that with AR, AI, Blockchain, IoT et all, right now is a great time to be alive and is probably what the early 1990’s with the Internet Boom felt like (though I was way too young back then to recollect much).

The uses of blockchain as a technology are endless.Â Some expect that in less than 10 years it will be used to collect taxes.Â There are a bunch of early adopters and start-ups who are doing a fabulous job in paving the path.

**\[A\] Practical applications of Block Chain technology beyond Cryptocurrency**

_**Providing Financial avenues & Economic freedom for those who have none**_ – Consider a third world nations in Africa where apart from a handful of cosmopolitan areas, the majority of them deal in cash. The continent of 1.2B inhabitants is mostly cut of from rest of the world economy.Â [BitPesa](https://www.bitpesa.co/) aims at solving Africa’s liquidity and money transfer issues. The Blockchain based app allows users to transact and do business across Africa with built in foreign exchange and business to business payment features. Simply put, blockchain here acts like a bank-like institution for people who do not have bank accounts.Â As long as you have a smart phone on an Internet plan, you will be able to conveniently and securely make transactions.

_**Distributed Cloud Storage (CDN) –**_ Blockchain data storage will be a massive disruptor by the turn of the decade. Current cloud storage is centralized and the users are bound to and must trust their storage provider who ‘control’ all the online assets in a central server. With Blockchain, this can turn decentralized. ‘[Storyj](https://storj.io/)‘ is a beta testing cloud storage that is powered by the Blockchain network to improve security and decrease dependency. Additionally, imagine a scenario where users such as you can rent out their excess storage capacity (think Airbnb), creating new market places. Anyone on the internet can store your data at a pre-agreed price. With greater security, uptime and faster delivery, this is shortly going to revolutionize the structures as we know it.

There are several other use cases where there is head ways are being made – from tackling [refugee crises](https://www.coindesk.com/united-nations-sends-aid-to-10000-syrian-refugees-using-ethereum-blockchain/) using crypto-currency based vouchers,Â preventing [voter fraud](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/follow-my-vote-inc) using the public ledger system, creating [digital identities](https://shocard.com/) so that you never have to worry about your online security ever again \[Sho Card\], Smart Contracts, decentralized notaries, blockchain music, healthcare etc. \[Read more on the top Blockchain applications [here ](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-applications/)andÂ Â [here \]](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ameer-rosic-/5-blockchain-applications%5Fb%5F13279010.html)

Now that we have established that the technology is here to stay, let us try understanding what it is and how it works.

**B. How does Block chain work?**

_**Scenario 1** – **Physical Transactions and Record keeping**_

Consider two folks – Alice and Bob to be sitting at a table. Alice has an apple that she wants to give to Bob. She places it in his hand and now Bob has the Apple. Alice now has 0 apples and Bob has 1\. We saw what happened and it was a physical transaction. No one else might be aware of it. Someone gives something to someone else in a regular barter.Â No matter what happens there is only 1 apple.

If Alice wants to give Bob something that she wants to track then she would use a ‘trustable ledger’. Think of a ledger as a large collection of data where balances of dollars or apples in this case are recorded for both Alice and Bob.

If these transactions were managed and tracked by say a third party company \[called say, LedgerManage\] then Alice will be sure of the transactions even if it did not know Bob.

_**Scenario 2** – **What if the dollar or apple was virtual?**_

Alice sends Bob a virtual apple. How did she send it? Say she sends it through say email then how does Bob know that she send the same apple and not just a copy? Bob cannot confirm that Alice has discarded the virtual copy of the apple so he isn’t sure if the one he has received is worth anything? Can Bob send it to someone else.Â Maybe Alice downloaded the virtual apple from the same place that hundreds of others have downloaded it from – then what value does the virtual apple even have?

A virtual transaction is clearly not like a physical transaction.Â The problem that Alice encountered is called the ‘[**Double spending problem**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp)‘. A bunch of smart folks have been trying to solve the double spending problem for a very long time.

_**Scenario 3 – How does one avoid the ‘Double Spending Problem’?**_

How can Alice and Bob both ensure that the virtual apple is not spent twice or many times. How can the data of the virtual apple be removed from Alice in such a way that Bob knows it is trust worthy?Â If Alice and Bob use some sort of digital ledger much like a physical one then does that solve the problem? Now Alice and Bob can transact the virtual apples as much as they like and whoever controls the ledger will have control over the transactions.

**_Scenario 4 – Who controls the ledger?_**

What if the controller of the ledger (or the company,Â LedgerManage in this case) made more apples or gave more apples to someone without proof of transaction? That doesn’t sound like someone that Alice or Bob may believe. What is the controller stops controlling it suddenly?

**_Scenario 5 – Making the Ledger Immutable_**

What if we gave this ledger to Alice and Bob and to everyone.Â What if everyone had a public ledger that has a copy of all transactions that has ever occurred? If it is public, Bob or Alice or anyone else wouldn’t be able to cheat the system since it won’t agree with everyone else on the network. And this ledger will be very difficult to destroy. Everyone within the ledger knows how these apples are transacted. If everyone in this agrees to the set of rules then everyone has trust of all virtual transactions and there is no single person who controls – thus the _control is decentralized_.

**_Scenario 6 – Anonymity and Transparency_**

Alice and Bob have ids in the ledger and everyone has access to it but no one knows the address belongs to Alice or Bob apart from themselves.Â This provides a layer of anonymity. But the transactions and its history are still identifiable and legitimate.

**_Scenario 7 – Public Consensus Network_**

These transactions are thus maintained by a network and it is in theÂ best interest for folks on the network to confirm these transactions so that the network can grow while still being as ‘trustable’. As a side note, a bitcoin works on the same technology by ‘rewarding’ those who confirm the transactions \[also, termed as mining\]

The public ledger is the technology powering Blockchain.

In simple terms, blockchain is a **_distributed database that maintains records_**. Refer to the ‘common public ledger’ we spoke about earlier. Each record is called a **_block_**. Each block contains history of every block that came before it. In that sense it chains the blocks together, thus the term ‘block chain’.

**\[C\] How is block chain secure?**

The entire operation is encrypted end to end. Every transaction is linked to a unique cryptographic signature that is easy to verify and nearly impossible to falsify because block chain is maintained by a scalable set of computers called ‘nodes’ worldwide.Â What makes this the most interesting is that **_‘all these computers around the world are coordinating with one another to make updates to the file in a lock-step fashion’_**. One of the best analogies is to think of it as a **_fossil record_** – as the examination of the fossil allows us to understand the order and time the layers were added, any individual can go back to the ‘layers’ in the file and it will be identical to everyone else’s file.

Anything that happens on the network only happens with consensus from the entire network. This is another reason why people trust blockchain- it gives proof.Â Think about a transaction where Alice is sending Bob 25 USD. What do we need to trust the transaction. Alice needs to verify that she is sending the money to Bob and Bob needs to verify that he is receiving it and the Bank has to update that Alice is 25 USD poorer and Bob is 25 USD richer.

Blockchain does this without a centralized unit such as a bank using _**‘Distributed Trustless Consensus**_‘ . No trust is required since Alice and Bob can see the transactions in the immutable ledger.

**\[D\] Why is Blockchain relevant right now?**

Modern technology allows us to communicate directly through audio and video between A to B, allowing us to trust the communication irrespective of whether it happens across continents. When it comes to money though, people have to trust a third party to be able to complete a transaction. Say a bank.

Blockchain technology challenges this status quo in a radical way. By using math and cryptography, **blockchain provides an open de-centralized database of** _**any transaction involving value – money, goods, property, work or even votes. It helps create a record whose authenticity can be verified by the entire community**_.

The future global economy will move towards one of distributed property and trust where anyone with access to the internet can get involved in block chain based transactions and third party trust organizations may no longer be necessary.

This technology has immense potential- It offers Transparency, Auditability, Traceability and Immutability of all transactions. 

> “_Blockchain is immutable; it cannot be changed, so records are permanently stored_“
> 
> Leanne Kemp, the founder of EverLedger

[Everledger](https://www.everledger.io/) is a startup that calls itself as the ‘digital vault’ of the future. The London based startup has placed more than 1.6M diamonds on a blockchain. Entries on the digital record include dozens of attributes for each diamond, including the color, carat, and certificate number, which can be inscribed by laser on the crown or girdle of the stone. It is helping reduce fraud in the diamond industry and guarantee diamond purity.

**\[E\] Re-thinking the future**

Wrapping our heads around what this could mean is a tad difficult. This World Economic Forum [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WG7D47tGb0)on the topic talks more about about how a decentralized internet could potentially occur sooner than expected across all the apps that we use. All essential services could be open source frameworks. Imagine an Uber that is decentralized and brings in a high level of competition. All of this is seemingly just the tip of the iceberg.

Unimaginable new networks will evolve to meet society’s needs more cheaply and potentially more securely. Will governments, financial and legal institutions embrace block chain. What happens to the ones who don’t?

**\[F\] Conclusion** 

I strongly believe we are the cusp of something huge. Reading the book Sapiens and about how we have evolved as a society makes me wonder if we have come back a full circle and finally put the power right where it belongs – in the hands of people. \[As a side note, for some strange reason this entire thing around networks brings back vivid memories of reading [God’s Delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FGod%5FDelusion) by Richard Dawkins\]

And since I have such a huge nerd-crush on Naval Ravikant, I will conclude with an extract from his thoughts on networks.

> “Humans are the networked species. The first species to network across genetic boundaries and thus seize the world.
> 
> Money is a network. Religion is a network. A corporation is a network. Roads are a network. Electricity is a network…Some are run by kings and priests who choose what is money and law, sacred and profane. Rule is closed to outsiders and based on power.

> The 20th century created a new kind of network – market networks. Open AND meritocratic.
> 
> Blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money.
> 
> To a blockchain, merit can mean security, computation, prediction, attention, bandwidth, power, storage, distribution, content.
> 
> Blockchains give us new ways to govern networks. For banking. For voting. For search. For social media. For phone and energy grids.
> 
> Blockchain-based market networks will replace existing networks. Slowly, then suddenly. In one thing, then in many things.
> 
> Ultimately, the nation-state is just a network (of networks)”

There are some random questions I ponder about at equally random times – whilst taking a shower, nodding away at a friend trying to explain something I clearly am not interested in or while at a salon when I am supposed to focus on my freshly painted nails. 

I am not sure I can articulate them well enough lest the person consider me insane. I am going to try though.

Do we know which language we dream in? I have told myself umpteen times that the next time I have a dream I need to stop to think about the language I have been spoken to or am speaking in. Brownie points for if I can recall if it was in color or B/W. Apparently I cant seem to use these Freudian techniques very well to extract a coherent answer from within me.

When I ‘think’ of something is that thought in a specific language? How do I seem to understand what my unconscious or my brain is telling me if there are no words spoken?

When I am tousling around problems and questioning myself about a solution I do not recall asking or receiving the ‘solution’ in as many words. Yet I know exactly what I am supposed to do. How do I understand it without a medium – or does communication with myself doesn’t require a media of language?

And finally, on a slightly different fork of linguistics, how am I voicing out my thoughts in the language of my choice even as I am thinking them? Does language then influence the decisions I take? To use a very naive example, will I exhibit being ‘morose’ if I did not know of an emotion called morose. If we did not have language would we still as humans show these traits and emotions that we do right now

Then I found this article on the Nautilus on what Paul McCarthy calls the [‘Kekule Problem’ – Where did language come from?](http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/the-kekul-problem)

To paraphrase _– “I call it the Kekule’s Problem because among the myriad instances of scientific problems solved in the sleep of the inquirer Kekule’s is probably the best known. He was trying to arrive at the configuration of the benzene molecule and not making much progress when he fell asleep in front of the fire and had his famous dream of a snake coiled in a hoop with its tail in its mouth “the ouroboros of mythology”and woke exclaiming to himself: It’s a ring. The molecule is in the form of a ring. Well. The problem of course is not Kekule’s but ours is that since the unconscious understands language perfectly well or it would not understand the problem in the first place, why doesnt it simply answer Kekules question with something like: Kekules, it’s a bloody ring. To which our scientist might respond: Okay. Got it. Thanks._

_Why the snake? That is, why is the unconscious so loathe to speak to us? Why the images, metaphors, pictures? Why the dreams, for that matter”_

Bingo. Doesn’t that hit home.

To give some context, 

_“Cormac McCarthy is best known to the world as a writer of novels. These include Blood Meridian, All the Pretty Horses, No Country for Old Men, and The Road. At the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) he is a research colleague and thought of in complementary terms. An aficionado on subjects ranging from the history of mathematics, philosophical arguments relating to the status of quantum mechanics as a causal theory, comparative evidence bearing on non-human intelligence, and the nature of the conscious and unconscious mind. At SFI we have been searching for the expression of these scientific interests in his novels and we maintain a furtive tally of their covert manifestations and demonstrations in his prose”_

\[ As a side note, I am curious to learn what kind of theoretical-research work actually happens in Sante Fe institute. ‘The institute is devoted to understanding the fundamental principles of complex systems at a variety of scales, from cell biology to human societies’ – sounds fascinating. Must read more\]

Mc Carthy’s answer to the problem appeared to him, apparently, as an epiphany of sorts, when he was clearing trash one morning is that the unconscious is   _just not used to giving verbal instructions and is not happy doing so. Habits of two million years duration are hard to break._ 

The seemed quite a bit of an anti-climax of an answer to me. I am not really sure why. Maybe I was expecting a profound, must-read-multiple-times to understand solution? Maybe the simplicity of it does not justify the depth of the question? \[Which reminds me of this other trick my mind plays on me correlating time/depth/complication with effort/ROI – I am always happier when the customer service representative at the other end takes a minute or so before getting back to me with the question I have posed. It, to my mind, implies that he/she has checked/done due diligence before providing an answer. For all you know (which may be exactly what is happening), he/she may just place me on hold and laugh over my ‘why not received product yet’ with her colleague). But I digress\]

\[Must add to reading list – [The Language Instinct](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0061336467/?tag=thneyo0f-20), Steven Pinkler & [Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior \]](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13058637-subliminal)

But the article though brings forth a very interesting point that I hadn’t considered before. 

How does our unconscious work? How does it help us? What is ‘I’? Is that my unconscious? Is that what guides my north star?

Maybe I need to think about it before I hit bed and see if my unconscious has an answer.

_‘Ask better questions_‘ is a precept I like to think that I live by.

 On that note, I came across this list of ‘[18 thought provoking questions that will free your mind](http://www.marcandangel.com/2017/12/31/18-thought-provoking-questions-that-will-free-your-mind-in-2018/)‘ by Mark Chernoff. 

Naive though that sounds, I did find some of the questions making me uncomfortable (which must be a good thing). So here is taking a shot at them, under a time limit, to ensure I do not fake a ‘sounds-better’ response. Also I think I’d like to revisit this oft to see how my responses vary and where my moral compass points to, over time

1. **In one sentence, who are you?** \[Yesterday I came across this hard-hitting note – “In 1962, Clare Boothe Luce, on of the first women to serve in the U.S. Congress, offered some advice to President John F. Kennedy. ‘A _great man_,’ she told him, ‘is _one sentence_.’ Abraham Lincoln’s _sentence_ was: ‘He preserved the union and freed the slaves.’\] – “I am a lifelong learner and I want to use knowledge to make a difference to my life and to the lives of those around me”
2. **In one word, what do you live for?** – Passion
3. **What is worth the pain?** – Knowing that you will come out a better person at the end of it.
4. **What will you never give up on?** – Integrity
5. **What do you always try to avoid?** – Altercations, even if at times, it may be required to be in disagreement.
6. **What’s is something that you take for granted every day?** – That the family would stand by me. Rock steady. At all times.
7. **What do you need most right now?** – Kindness to myself. Patience towards others.
8. **What would you immediately do differently if you knew no one would judge you?** – Try new stuff – such as modeling, maybe
9. **What is something nobody could ever steal from you?** Memories – real and made-up.
10. **Who would you like to forgive right now?** My younger self – I am quite harsh on how I judge my 20 year old self in having taken the decisions that she did.
11. **Happiness is not?** White Sugar
12. **What impact do you want to leave on the people you love?** That I tried.
13. **Life is too short to tolerate?** Gas lighting
14. **What is something that used to scare you, but no longer does?** Approaching strangers and exploring strange new ideas
15. **What do you want to remember forever?** My dad’s look of pride
16. **What do you always look forward to?** A good book and better conversations
17. **What recently reminded you of how fast the time flies?** Aging school friends
18. **What’s something everyone should be able to say before they die?** I didn’t regret that

I think I’d leave this here to remind myself the next time I take this the next year.

I finally got my act together to write about the most popular MooC of all time yesterday – ‘[Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)‘ – Powerful mental tools to master tough subjects. 

It is created by [Barbara Oakley](http://www.barbaraoakley.com/) (University of Oakland) and [Terry Sejnowski](http://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski/) (the Salk Institute) and it focuses on how we can use neuroscience to fine-tune our abilities to learn.

1. Every time I push myself to get something done and in the process get overwhelmed I am reminded of my grandmom’s story of ‘s_top to sharpen the axe_‘. This is definitely one that would fall in that category. Pausing to think about how we learn – in terms of techniques used by experts, how to deal with procrastination and mastering difficult subjects is bound to help all – a student, professional or just someone who is curious about the world around.

This iteration of the course on Coursera started on 8th Jan – below are my notes and reading recommendations from Week 1.

Here is Barbara Oakland’s TEDx speech on the topic before we get started

**Week 1 – Notes**

**Reading Recommendations** – Most of the content of the course is based on the book by the same author- [‘A Mind for Numbers’ ](https://www.amazon.in/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515647713&sr=8-1&keywords=a+mind+for+numbers)

Most of the tools and techniques recommended is drawn from research and findings in the areas of cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

**Section 1 – Focused and Diffused Thinking**

Our thinking pattern often switches between these two neural states. Diffused thinking is mostly one which corresponds to the neural resting state. The brain cannot function in both states at the same time (it is like two sides to a coin)

1. **PinBall Machine Analogy** : The way the brain works can be thought of as a pinball machine. Familiar thought pattern travels smoothly across strong neural pathways, much like traveling through a paved road. New neural patterns on the other hand are weaker.Â \[Side Note\] – Analogies and Metaphors are great way for learning new things and formed strong pathways.
2. **Diffused thinking mode**  – Some specific examples of great thinkers who used this mode of thinking successfully include [Salvadore Dali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador%5FDal%C3%AD), the creative genius who was considered ‘wild and crazy’. His genius ideas were often drawn from diffused thinking periods when he rested on a chair thinking about open-ended questions and go into the ‘free-thinking-mode’ with a bunch of keys held in his hands. He would eventually fall asleep and drop his key bunch and thereby wake up to the clanking noise. Once awake he could then gather the diffused mode points and apply it to his art. Barbara also extend this example to Albert Einstein doing the same exercise, albeit whilst thinking about science and holding a bunch of ball-bearings in his hand instead.
3. **Regular practice** – The key to resolving problems therefore is to switch between the two modes of thinking with the mind going back and forth, especially in the cases of not so common problems. To build a strong neural structure, practicing a little bit of this every day helps.
4. **Understanding the working of the brain** – The brain is one of the most complex devices in the entire world. We are not consciously aware about how the brain works or influences thought processes. We have a billion or more synapses. Brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures. Synapses are less than a micron in diameter and they are constantly changing when we learn. This implies that we aren’t the same person when we wake up as vs the person who went to bed. Let us just think about that for a minute – _‘You are different people at different points in your life-time’_
5. It is possible to take advantage of our unconscious mind in the sleep to improve performance

**Section 2 – Procrastination, Memory and Sleep** 

1. When we look at something we really ‘aren’t keen on doing’, our brain perceives it as equivalent to ‘pain’ and does whatever is possible to divert attention to something else so as to make the pain go away.
2. **Neural Discomfort** though disappears if you work through the initial bit of unease that you feel.
3. **\[Technique alert\]** – [Pomodoro Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro%5FTechnique) is something that can help you through this. It involves setting a timer to 25 minutes to focus on a particular task with absolutely no distractions \[Reminded me of the psychological state of ‘[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow%5F%28psychology%29)‘\] and then taking a 5 minute break to let the mind recoup, wander and gather its thoughts. I personally use [KanbanFlow.com](https://kanbanflow.com) for this and absolutely vouch for the efficacy of the technique. I get more done in 3-5 stretches of uninterrupted Pomodoros’ than would the entire rest of the day.
4. **Practice makes permanent and why math and science are seemingly frustrating to many** – Many folks find the concepts more frustrating in math and science than in others, say literature. This is mostly because mathematical ideas are not analogous to other concrete examples. What this implies is that we need to practice to give our brain a chance to gather the concepts and build stronger pathways.
5. **Neuron Patterns & Pathways** – Neurons become linked together because of repeated use. Practice makes permanent.![](https://i0.wp.com/thetrifecta.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/download-300x150.jpg?resize=300%2C150)
6. **Avoiding Procrastination** – The key thus is to Focus intently > take a break > focus. The neutral mode allows the gathered information to sink in.

**Section 3 – Chunking**

1. We have two types of memory systems – long term memory and working memory systems.
2. **Working Memory system** – It is the one that you consciously use currently (present in the prefrontal cortex). At any given point in time it can hold a maximum of only 4 chunks of information. It is often needed to repeat the information to be remembered (recall repeating the phone number?). It can thus be thought of as an ‘inefficient black board’. This is thus also **limited in nature.**
3. **Long term memory system** – This is distributed across the brain and can be thought of as an efficient warehouse. It is recommended to revisit this a few times in order to find it when needed more efficiently. The warehouse capacity can be immense and all fundamental techniques and concepts are held here.
4. **Spaced repetition** – This is the key to remembering and moving concepts from working to long term memory. Also it is important to repeat it over days instead of cramming it all on one day.
5. **Importance of sleep in learning** – When we sleep our brain cells shrink and fluid is then able to wash out the collected toxin which then enables us to think better the next day. Apart from this sleep also helps tidy the concepts picked up during the day and helps retain them better while de-activating unrelated concepts. Also reading about concepts before bed or thinking about them makes once clarify them during sleep.

**Section 4 – Interview with Terrence Sejnowski**

1. How do we best learn new stuff – Get hands dirty. Get into a lab and learn through doing and through osmosis (learning from other experts)
2. How do we attend to what you do not like? – Ask a question/Active engagement
3. Technique that has helped? – Use diffused mode thinking – walking, jogging, free-thinking allows new ideas to bubble up. Take a notebook along.
4. Resist multi-tasking. Context switching between tasks is individual dependent.
5. How do you apply knowledge of neuroscience to own learning? -Â ‘All neurons we had at birth, wiring takes place and learning happens’. Hippocampus — new neurons are born even in adulthood. If you have a animal(rat) and if you give an enriched environment and look at the Hippocampus – it is much stronger than one in an impoverished environment. Be surrounded by people who stimulate you. In absence of that – exercise is very helpful. New educational systems – recess is thus essential. Brain needs a moment of pause to process the information.
6. Advise about learning? – Success isn’t necessarily about being smart. It mostly comes from passion and persistence. And Grit.

Cant wait for the next week’s sessions. Much love till then!

I started re-reading this book ([Drive – Daniel Pink](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive)) recently on what really motivates people and how our paradigms of learning, fulfillment and intrinsic rewards are changing rapidly. It reminded me of reinforcement learning (in the context of ML and AI). A concept I have attempted to deconstruct below.

Machine Learning (ML) focuses on creating intelligent programs or ‘agents’ through the process of ‘learning’.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Reinforcement_learning_diagram.svg_-1.png?resize=250%2C242&ssl=1)

**What is Reinforcement Learning?**

1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one approach of ML** in which the agent learns through interaction with its environment and through the results of the interactions.
2. This is essentially a **mimicry of how humans learn** \[side note – quoting Alan Turing – “Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the _child’s_?\]
3. In this, the algorithm allows the software agents to automatically determine the ‘ideal behavior’ within a specific context that ‘**maximizes its performance**‘ – **“Reinforcement learning is concerned with the problem of finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward.” \[[Ref](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fcmbishop%2Fprml%2F)\]**
4. **No specific goals** – The algorithms thus arent provided with explicit goals and end up learning them through trial and error (much like how we, as humans learn)
5. **Lets talk examples and use cases** – Reinforcement systems can be understood from the perspective of games which come with a clear objective that is awarded points. As shown in this [example](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/reinforcement-learning-6eacf258b265), say the mouse is looking at getting to a piece of cheese at the end of a maze (+1000 points) and gets an intermediate award of +10 points on the way (for say, water). There is also negative reinforcement in the form of electric shocks (-100 points). After exploring around a bit, the mouse may find a bunch of smaller rewards in form of water – but if it sticks around there it may miss the bigger award of the cheese at the end. It thus has to decide on a **trade-off between exploration/exploitation** (much like decisions we puzzle over). One strategy might be to take the best known action for a majority of the time (80%+) but occasionally explore newer options or directions in this case that may result in an unknown reward (even it if means walking away from the known and available reward i.e water in this case) \[ Here is a [paper](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching%5Ffiles/XX.pdf) from UCL related to ‘exploitation vs exploration’ but that deep-dive is for another article\] – This is referred to as the ‘[**epsilon-greedy strategy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed%5Fbandit)‘. Here epsilon refers to the percent of time that the agent takes a randomly selected action rather than the action that is most likely to maximize the reward given what it knows so far (that is the 20% minority route). We usually start with a high value of epsilon (i.e, a large % of time look at taking the unknown initially/exploration) but over time the mouse (or us) learn about the maze and learn about which results in a long term reward and reduce epsilon steadily (i.e – prefer the routes that are known) until it reaches 10% or lesser to exploiting what it already knows.![](https://i0.wp.com/thetrifecta.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1_HvoLc50Dpq1ESKuejhICHg-300x147.png?resize=300%2C147)

source – ML for humans

**To summarize**, RL is a ‘goal oriented’ algorithm where the learning happens not from a training set but from the agent’s interaction with the environment.

RL is considered to be the hope and driving force behind true AI given its immense learning potential.

Here is an immensely astounding (and slightly alarming) video of Google’s DeepMind AI that taught itself how to walk without any prior guidance.

**So how is RL different from other Machine Learning**? – RL does not have existing training data (like in most Supervised learning) and the agent learns from experience. It collects the training examples as it encounters them – through trial and error as it attempts them (‘this action was good, this was bad’) with the aim of maximizing long term reward. Here is a classification of different types of ML from [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-implementation/)![](https://i0.wp.com/thetrifecta.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ml_types-300x191.png?resize=514%2C327)

It is thus clearly seen that unlike ‘Supervised Learning’, RL doesn’t have an ‘external supervisor’ which has and shares knowledge of the environment with the agent to complete the task.Â And unlike in ‘Unsupervised Learning’, RL has a mapping from the input to the output which is not present in Unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning focuses on learning ‘underlying patterns’ in the provided training data. RL creates the data and learns through its attempts at maximizing the end reward.

* The [actions](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/RL1/introduction.html) thus can be summarized as follows – The **“cause and effect”** idea can be translated into the following steps for an RL agent:  
   1. The agent observes an input state  
   2. An action is determined by a decision making function (policy)  
   3. The action is performed  
   4. The agent receives a scalar reward or reinforcement from the environment  
   5. Information about the reward given for that state / action pair is recorded

**Where is RL used?** – RL problems are potentially those that can be solved without external supervision – complex problems where there appears to be no obvious or easily programmable solutions. Two main areas where the currently applications span are –

* **Game Playing** – Think Chess
* **Control Problems** – Say, Elevator scheduling

More details related to the use cases, deep-dive of the algorithms and techniques are covered in part 2 of the post.

I was scrolling through my LinkedIn feed, when I came across this concept called the Minto Pyramid Principle.

_[Minto Pyramid Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Minto-Pyramid-Principle-Writing-Thinking/dp/0960191038)_, also referred to as the **McKinsey’s _Pyramid Principle_**, is a tool used to process and structure large amounts of information to convey a story, message or presentation without omitting important details.

 A concept which is apparently a widely used management paradigm.

Source – Slidebooks

**Background** – It is a framework on structured thinking conceptualised by Barbara Minto. Used widely by consultants. Based on the book – **The Minto Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing, Thinking and Problem Solving**.

**What** – Your success highly depends on how well you can communicate your ‘story’

**How** – Structure your thoughts and communication in the below format

* Situation (state of affairs)
* Complication (what is changing to make things harder)
* Question (That the situation and complication demands)
* Answer (One’s particularly ingenious solution)

With the solution stated, one spends the rest of the time providing evidence and arguments supporting the statement. It is thus a pyramid.

The answer is thus the most important thing in the room – not the status quo or the as-is. Each level of the pyramid supports the level above.  
Evidence supports Arguments and arguments support answer.  
Finally it helps remove unnecessary information.

If a fact doesn’t support the answer then it is removed. It thus removed the noise that prevents one from getting to one’s goal.

Life lessons : This, I believe, would work beyond consultative presentations and in life in itself. Having a constant focus on the outcome vs the output moves us from being constantly ‘busy’ to productive in what we seek to achieve.

_\[Apart from questioning existence\]_

### 1\] When Sci-Fi meets Reality!

I have been reading John Scalzi’s [Old Man’s War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old%5FMan%27s%5FWar%5Fseries) Sci-Fi series – one where humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce– and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding. And towards this we bring the ‘conscious’ of the old into newer, genetically created bodies that communicate through brain pals which are neural Augmentation technology used by The [Colonial Defense Force](https://oldmanswar.fandom.com/wiki/Colonial%5FDefense%5FForces) for their soldiers in the means to communicate….

Never a better time to read about Brain Machine Interfacing.

If a person from the neolithic age were to pay us a visit now, he would in all probability die trying the assimilate the new order of the world and technological prowess. But over a 100 thousand years, our brains have remained the same. Take a minute to digest that.

We have the same brain as the neanderthal.

The world has totally changed.

Here is a [TEDx video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgFzmE2fGXA) that talks about it \[ By [Steve Hoffman](https://www.foundersspace.com/captainhoff) – the founder of Founder Space\]. Notes from the session below. I feel a tad uncomfortable with this one and I will explain why in a bit.

It talks a bit like preaching to puritans. The technology is immensely amazing and has repercussions beyond what our brain can handle right now (pun intended).

The key I think though is on how we decide to go ahead with integrating this in our lives – ethically, morally and legally. Those decisions are yet to be made.

By us.

And the manner in which the common man is exposed to this information will have a huge say in how this might be welcomed or otherwise.

We do not like to play god. We do not like those who like to play god. This video does just that – drowns us with multiple disconcerting facts at us even before we can come to terms with what could potentially change lives as we know of it. It leaves our already on-the edge brains with a conclusion the reads like a death knell. The technology in itself is inevitable albeit there are other [sources ](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html)one could start with for example.

The importance of setting the right context has never been more important.

Nevertheless, the short video does state what is currently happening on the topic of **Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI) or Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)**. It certainly needs a follow-up though from journals and scientists who are not necessarily angel investors.

We have now started to change our brains. We are doing this with new technology. Some basic technology like EEG allows us to measure brain waves. It can tell our concentration levels. They can also be used to move a cursor on the screen. They are working on them in controls in games. They are used in Medicine – as in PTSD and ADHD. They have applications for children to study. But where are we headed eventually?

### **2\] Brain Chips and moving Robotic arms**

These devices are capable of recording dreams – in a very primitive way. Right now, scientists in labs around the world are developing ‘brain chips’.

They are chips that can be inserted into the brains and are wireless.

> A paralyzed monkey, was inserted with a chip in the brain and lower spine that allowed it to communicate and allowed the primate to walk again. Now there are monkeys in labs with chips in the brain and just by thinking, the monkeys can drive the wheel chair around. Just by thinking, a monkey could move an external robotic arm to get food.

### **3\] Who are the humans who will benefit from it first**

When we think about where the technology is headed – this is where we are going. People who get brain chips first are the ones with debilitating brain conditions where the chips could restore the quality of life.

### 4\] Mind to Mind Communication

Scientists have done experiments with rats. They could teach a rat to do specific things to get food. It took the rat weeks to learn that behavior. **Then they hooked the chip in the rats brain to the internet where the knowledge (or the ability to get food) was transferred from the brain of another rat in another city to the first one who immediately found the right pathways. If we stop to think of it is ‘transfer of knowledge’ across the brains of two individuals across continents wirelessly through the brain chips.** There is immense potential to this in humans – **mind to mind**‘ **communication** is the realm of sci-fi which is now turning into a reality. If we look at a world where we look at chips connected to the internet it will imply that we can actually google for information from within the brain.

### 4\] Transferring memories living outside of our bodies

Imagine being able to transfer the feeling of what ‘skydiving’ feels like to a friend. Imagine we can experience the lives of others and their memories. We may not know the difference between our own memory and those acquired from others. Information will be ‘commoditized’ and on-demand. All of us will have infinite access to information. We will be connected to everything. Not only will we be able to get knowledge but have full experiences within our heads.

In the future we can download an environment and actually live in it. The difference between us dreaming and reality will be blurred. We will be spending a lot of time outside of our bodies. When we are connected to the internet we are no longer trapped to our bodies.

### 5\] Recreating experiences and living others’ lives

Imagine being able to actually recreate the entire experience and physical sensations of being on Mars, for example. Imagine being in Elon Musk’s head right now (if he allowed you to do that). We can transfer emotions.

> Humans will thus never be alone.

### 6\] Beyond the 5 senses

Suddenly if we are connected to a world of machines and sensors. We will not just have 5 senses but multiple senses like IR and UV that we have never experienced before. Our live today will be totally alien to us. We will be living in a whole new reality. We can have many lives since we live through the lives of others. Nirvana or a state of non-being talks about how our consciousness is not tied to our bodies. This technology comes very close to getting us there. We will be redefining what the human experience is the first time in history.

Technology is really powerful. We have seen how, say with cell-phones, our lives have changed tremendously. In the future, when the internet becomes us, we need to understand as the society and the human race, that this comes with a lot of responsibility. Imagine someone being able to hack your brain and implant memories. This technology that can so radically transform our lives potentially can also get us to a really bad place.

We are going to be making decisions around this in our life times.

“A **data lake** is usually a single store of all enterprise **data** including raw copies of source system **data** and transformed **data** used for tasks such as reporting, visualization, advanced analytics and machine learning”, says the Wiki definition.

**1\] What is a Data lake**

* It is essentially a Storage Repository
* Holds large amount of data
* Stores it in its ‘native format’ until it is needed
* The data can thus be in a structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. The structure is not defined until the data is required.

**2\] How is it different from a data warehouse?**

* While an hierarchical data warehouse holds it as data or files or folders, a data lake uses a flat structureÂ to store data.
* It is a low cost storage solution whilst being highly agile with configuration/re-configuration capabilities are required.

**3\] How is it stored?**

* Each element in a data lake is assigned an unique identifier and tagged with a set of metadata tags.
* When a requirement arises, the datalake can be queried for the specific data which can then be analyzed to help answer the question

The term data lake is usually associated with Hadoop – object oriented storage. In such a scenario, an organization’s data is first loaded into the hadoop platform and then the data mining tools are applied onto the data that resides in the Hadoop Clusters

\[**Side note on Hadoop**\]

Hadoop is an open source, Java-based programming framework that supports the processing and storage of extremely large data sets in distributed computing environment. It is part of the Apache project sponsored by the Apache software foundation. Hadoop allows one to run applications on systems with thousands of community nodes and handles thousands of terabytes of data. Its distributed file system facilitates rapid data transfer rates among nodes and allows the system to continue operating in the case of node failure\]

James Dixon, the founder and CTO of Pentaho, has been credited with coming up with the term. This is how he describes a data lake:

> _If you think of a datamart as a store of bottled water “ cleansed and packaged and structured for easy consumption”, the data lake is a large body of water in a more natural state. The contents of the data lake stream in from a source to fill the lake, and various users of the lake can come to examine, dive in, or take samples._

Learning more about the brain fascinates me. 

I have kind of being doing a lot of reading (and listening) around this. And interestingly, over time they all seem to interlink to each other. It is like joining the dots in disparate puzzles. I think I’d like to do a deep-dive into each of these to understand more around where we actually are and who are the companies who are working on them. But for now, here is an overview of them – from learning more about raising kids, the future of ‘thinking’ and our identities as we know of them.

1. **Neuralink, BMI and having a magical hat** – The first one I’d like to gain more understanding about is on Elon Musk’s new venture (which is smashingly exciting) much like most of his other ventures. [Neuralink](https://www.neuralink.com/) in short is a neurotechnology company that is working on developing implantable BCIs (brain computer interfaces).Â I could do no justice in explaining the massive 2 post long article on [WBW ](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html)that explains how Musk is essentially trying to bring together man and machine. It redefines much of what human life would look like in the future. Though it seems like science fiction right now, I very strongly believe we aren’t too far away from having a seamless interaction with machine (which are for now an extension of us through the multiple gadgets). Imagine asking (thinking, not even voicing verbally, mind you) what the weather in New York is like and getting a response that is not just limited to the data but one could actually feel the cold temperature sitting right here. Every time I read more about this I feel like I am within the pages of Harry Potter and looking forward to ‘[apparate](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Apparition)‘ without using a[ Portkey](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Portkey) or F[loo Powder. ](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Floo%5FPowder)Â Right now, I have so much running around in my brain around all this disparate stuff which is seemingly connected. If only I could share my ‘brain’ with someone who could ‘read’ what I choose to share without me actually vocalizing it. Actually, if Neuralink succeeds in doing what it is trying to do, we may actually get there very soon.

2) **[Brain – The story of you](https://www.amazon.in/Brain-Story-You-David-Eagleman/dp/1101870532)** : I recently finished this brilliant book by David Eagleman. Definitely is one of the best reads I have ever come across in a long time. I think I highlighted more sections than I ever have. It gives us a great background about not just the ‘physical structure’, the significance of brain development in the initial 4-5 years and questions your identity. I recollect the case study of a bunch of 3 siblings who grew up in an orphanage in Romania who though supplied with the basic necessities, were deprived of nurture, care and love by the caretakers. The family who adopted them when they were around 5+ found that the kids were irreparably broken and depressed. They in fact used gibberish to communicate and the depression followed. He also talks about how kids who are born pretty ‘unready’ compared to other mammals ‘learn’ from the environment. The neurons that fire together are retained. Learning is thus a process of constantly experiences and pruning out the unnecessary. It reiterates the significance of the initial years in shaping the future of the child.

If you think this all sounds like a lot of baloney and want more reasons to pick up the book – look at this [article](https://www.yahoo.com/news/two-brains-both-belong-three-120608571.html?soc%5Fsrc=community&soc%5Ftrk=fb) which provides evidence of the brain sizes of 3 yo kids cherished and and nurtured by their moms versus those who have been abused and neglected

3) **What constitutes ‘you’?** – The book, though technical, still delves into narratives of reality and illusion. What constitutes ‘you’ – is it your memories. Can these memories be transferred to an external substrate. Would that still be you? Is you your ‘conscious’? If you are not conscious during your sleep, what constitutes the ‘conscious’. Is the raw material – the bunch of neurons and synapses that make the brain – you? If each neuron is just there to fulfill a particular activity, does the ‘[emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)‘ of them together constitute your ‘conscious’. Do we see a future where the BMI (brain machine interfaces) actually will be a part of ‘you’. Did you know there is company in the area of Cryonics – [Alcor](http://alcor.org/) that preserves bodies (or just the heads in certain cases) with the hope that one day (in the visible future) we will learn how to transfer our ‘consciousness’ beyond our frail bodies and they can be ‘revived back into a second life’. The meaning of ‘being mortal’ may be very different from what we actually know of it now.

4) **Of Brain plasticity, vision boards and rewiring the brain for success** – The very premise of the books- ‘[Think and grow rich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30186948-think-and-grow-rich)‘ or ‘[‘The Secret’](https://www.thesecret.tv/) is just that – one tends to achieve their goals by having a clarity of vision and through actually ‘thinking’ about them often enough. One of the things I have come across in multiple articles (and reiterated in this book) is the ability of the brain to re-mold itself completely – termed [brain plasticity or neuroplasticity.](https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticity)

Clearly this is a function that is very pliable in kids and thus their propensity to pick up things much easier than adults. It is a function of the brain though that is retained throughout our adult lives – we have but to work towards it. In the last couple of days since I read the book I constantly find myself thinking about how my brain thinks (metacognition – ability to observe, witness and understand how the mind works to create the reality of your experience \[PS- Meditation and mindfulness is what aids one to get to a state of metacognition\]) – about how the author had explained that each thought or experience is but a bunch/formation of neurons that fire together. The recollection of the taste of the mango yogurt for example is when we try to fire the same set of neurons. The more they fire together, the stronger the memory. Which brings me to the next point – the power of visualization in achieving our goals. As this article illustrates the ‘[secret of success](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/295885)‘ through hacking your brain to be more productive, using visualization (think vision boards), journal-ling, meditation and strengthening memories you like to retain through repeated practice.

This is a lot of information in one go – but constantly I finds things to be more interconnected that they appear to be. It is a great time to be alive.

P.S – Additional reading recommendations from last week’s reading – [‘Call of the Wild’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FCall%5Fof%5Fthe%5FWild) (absolutely great literature written from the perspective of a dog in search of his self and finding ‘home’) and [‘Being Mortal’ ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20696006-being-mortal)(a doctor who talks about the difference between being alive and existing).

> Naval Ravikant

I have an absolute nerd crush on the guy. I love the lucidity and the depth at which he thinks. Of all the precepts he seems to constantly spew, this is the one I have been contemplating much.

**Playing Iterated games and Compounding**

By nature, we are very highly fickle minded, and constantly interest-hop from one to another. In true spirit of being retrospective, I kept track and then analysed my month’s worth of actions against these. \[I use [Kanbanflow ](https://kanbanflow.com/board/29fa73fb1e1e11d347b872ad6b7abda8)\].

1. **Knowledge**: This is probably my biggest take-away of it all. For the longest time, I maintained an ‘ideas journal’ and often wrote down ideas that excite me. Looking back I realize that a lot of things did. I was interested in creating goal setting journals that I used for myself, learning about Amazon FBA’s, scoping out Blockchain opportunities in our country, obsession in learning more about future of AI and Superintelligence, making perfumed soaps and having story telling sessions with kids, being underwhelmed by our education system and wanting to revolutionize the STEM and K2 education, creating a podcast for working moms, write e-books on road-trips, exploring the travel industry with the husband, et all. While I don’t necessarily regret learning, I think going deep is what compounds knowledge. I still love learning and books help. My mom oft complained that I would pretty much devour any sheet with ink on it. But whilst I continue to learn about things that excite me, I think I will focus on sprinting down a path that compounds over time.
2. **Wealth** – Compounding is the greatest known secret to wealth. Money is the greatest leverage to, well, making more money.  
   * **Wealth Creation isn’t evil** : Overcome the negative connotation associated with money. Money in itself isn’t evil. What one could do with it, could be. Creating wealth (vs. making money) can be a goal for by doing that one is creating something of value.  
   * **Profit First** (based on Mike Michalowicz’ awesome [book](https://www.amazon.in/Profit-First-Transform-Cash-Eating-Money-Making-ebook/dp/B01HCGYTH4)): Creating a mindset change of how we look at expenses and doing it over and over.![Image result for profit first](https://i0.wp.com/rmukeshgupta.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Profit-First-formula.png?resize=533%2C267)
3. **Relationships**: This was interesting. I have never considered compounding in the context of relationships. But in reality, most of our closest relationships are the one’s that have compounded over time – like a marriage.  
   * **Build relationships** over time with people who truly matter. And be consistent over time.  
   * **Exit relationships** that suck early on because compounding makes it harder to step out given the time invested
4. **Health** : If anyone needs any reasons to stick to compounding, it is probably best reflected in how much one could change oneself over time if one wants to. I included this to the list since well I went from a 90 kg+ bloated post pregnant mom with severe pre-eclampsia to 65 kgs and 25% body fat – over time. One day at a time. Every day.

And finally, in action through iterations. ‘Doing’ beats everything else. To improve against any of the above requires action. And progress. And to fail. And to try again. So the single best thing I learnt was to have an **action bias**.

> The universe doesn’t give you what you ask for with your thoughts – it gives you what you demand with your actions.
