A mentor once told me a secret

To do well at the workplace

And in life

‘Assuming Goodwill’

Conflicts and disagreements at workplaces, are inevitable

There are two ways in which I have seen people handle such –

Victimhood and Cynicism

The former assumes the mentality of blame – that makes one lose a sense of control over their environment

The other – ‘brings out the worst in their colleagues, leading cynics’ suspicion and distrust to become self-fulfilling prophecies”

Largely, people have the right intentions and misses could be gaps in communication or misaligned priorities

When you approach situations assuming goodwill – one starts with curiosity to learn why vs going in with a fixed mindset

This article shares ‘tactics include redirecting the organisational culture toward collaboration and trust and making sure that all managers—not just those at the top—are modeling trusting behaviours and combating cynicism in their interaction’

What behaviours have you or your leaders helped model within your teams towards better outcomes?
