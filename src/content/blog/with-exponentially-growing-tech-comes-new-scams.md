With exponentially growing tech comes new scams.

“Scammers are using artificial intelligence to sound more like family members in distress. People are falling for it and losing thousands of dollars”

“Two years ago, even a year ago, you needed a lot of audio to clone a person’s voice,” Farid said. “Now … if you have a Facebook page … or if you’ve recorded a TikTok and your voice is in there for 30 seconds, people can clone your voice.”

“Technology amplifies underlying human forces”

Which is both the good and bad – and as the tech uncovers newer areas of progress, it will also bring with it newer ways of scamming folks.

Please share the word and kindly create awareness with your elders in the family or other who may not be as tech savvy.
