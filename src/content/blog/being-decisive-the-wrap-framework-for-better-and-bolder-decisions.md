Should I resign this job? Should I move to a new city? Is this the stream I want to pursue?  
How can we take better decisions?

Regardless of whether you are a student or a professional, the quality of the decisions you make ultimately determines the quality of your life.

The 4 villains of decision making are –  
#1Narrow framing \[this/that decisions\],  
#2Confirmation Bias \[looking to confirm what we already believe in\]  
#3ShortTermEmotionalRationalization  
#4Overconfidence

Being Decisive – The WRAP framework for better and bolder decisions

To overcome this, Chip and Dan Heath propose the WRAP framework  
W -Widen your options  
R – Reality-test your assumptions  
A – Attain distance before deciding  
P – Prepare to be wrong
