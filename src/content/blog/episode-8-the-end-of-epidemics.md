“When 2 year old Emilie grabbed and poked a dead bat from a tree, a few particles of blood landed on his hands, and as toddlers do, he put his fingers in his mouth. Soon after, he grew agonizingly ill… “

The 2018 written book, talks about how Epidemics pose a looking threat to humanity.

He calls out seven set of concrete steps to stop killer viruses from destroying millions of lives. A new pandemic he states could kill more than 300 million people and reduce global GDP by 5 to 10 percent.

He talks of how deforestation, climate change and population movement are turning wildlife into pandemic incubators and lessons learnt from SARS, Zika and Ebola. “The equivalent of just 1 USD per year per person on the planet (around 7.5 billion annually) will save lives and pay for itself in lower emergency costs and reduced economic disruption’, he stated. He also talks about how the ‘global food industry is failing to safeguard people from microbes such as viruses that cause influenza’

A book that aims at making the world safer from infectious outbreaks.
