Career pivots and How to make them happen?

We oft get questions around how to make career transitions

From a program to a product manager. Or a software engineer to a data scientist.

A long while ago, a technical engineer reached out expressing his interest in becoming a data scientist. Long story short, after 8 weeks of shadowing the role, he realised that there was much more to it than ‘model building’.

He did not enjoy the alignment with stakeholders nor the scouring for data from several sources.

“It’s easy to generate a fantasy in your mind’s eye about what it’d be like to have a different job. But before you take any steps toward making a change, it’s useful to test – is it really something you’d enjoy?”
