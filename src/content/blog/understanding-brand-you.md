How do you describe your brand?  
  
We did an interesting 10 min branding exercise recently at a Leadership workshop.  
  
“If you were a known commercial brand, Which one would you be? What 3 adjectives would you use to describe the brand? Who would be the primary customer type? What would be its differential value?”  
  
Each of us asked folks from our professional and personal circles to answer these questions. Post which we reflected on the ‘Brand” we project.  
And most importantly, is this perceived ‘Brand’ close to your ‘desired one’  
  
So I am quite curious about what the LinkedIn community would have to say to these questions.  
Which one would I be? What 3 adjectives would you use to describe my brand?  
\[Feel free to DM\]  
  
(On a related note, it is a worthwhile exercise for all of us to do at some point in time. For whether you do it intentionally or otherwise, you are always projecting ‘brand you’!)
