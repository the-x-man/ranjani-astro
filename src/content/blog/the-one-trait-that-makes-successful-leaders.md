What is the one thing that makes exceptional leaders?

Earlier in my career, I reached out to a women leader – someone I admired but didn’t know at all.

She chose to make time for someone who wanted to be her.

In my raw ambition, I told her my grand career plans and all that I wanted to do. She smiled and unlike most who found it ridiculous, asked me to ‘tell me more’.

I felt heard.

In retrospective, there is one thing I have consistency noticed exceptional leadership do well

Treat people fairly.

Irrespective of where you come from, what level you are at or what your views are.

Be nice. Be respectful.

Its not about valuing people equally but treating people equitably

“And when you attempt to treat everyone the same, you ignore their uniqueness and minimize their perspective and experience.

You end up devaluing them.

As leaders, we must understand that equality applies to human dignity—all people are created with value; all people deserve to be treated respectfully and with an eye towards human worth.

Equity is different from equality”

Be nice. Be respectful.

It is singularly a massive competitive advantage.
