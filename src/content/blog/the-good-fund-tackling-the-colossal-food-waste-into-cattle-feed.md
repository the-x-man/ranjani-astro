I have an extremely visceral reaction to food that is wasted.

My grandmother was widowed at a very young age with around 9 kids between 23 to 2

With a meagre monthly pension to support her, she indexed on making sure her kids were educated. She was deeply intelligent and ensured that every resource at her disposal went all the way.

Since our parents had full time jobs, she raised my brother and I. And a non-negotiable was waste. Zero waste was a concept she followed even before it was made fancy.

[Nikhil Bohra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) led agritech, [Krimanshi](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) works on upcycling food waste into low cost, high quality, nutritious cattle feed and fodder.

Around 1.3Bn tonnes of food each year gets wasted, reports the Food and Agriculture Organization. Food losses and waste amounts to roughly $310 bn in developing countries.

Much of the agri waste, \~ 31 crore tons, is burnt while another 10 crore tons of grains, fruits and vegetables are lost due to poor storage and logistics. This is where a great business opportunity lies for startups such as Krimanshi.

The Jodhpur based startup leverages tech to ‚Äòupcycles food waste collected from farms, produce markets and other sources and dehydrates them in a controlled environment‚Ä¶‚Äô into low cost cattle feed.

‚ÄúThe primary beneficiaries of this social enterprise today include, low-income, dairy farmers who cannot, otherwise, afford high-protein dairy feed, and therefore are unable to sustain profitable milk production‚Äù

As I learn more about tech startups driving social impact, I realize that there are hardly any with women founders üôÇ

My hope is, at some point in the future, to start a VC fund directed at **#StartupsforSocialImpact** ‚Äì **#TheGoodFund**

Towards that, as I learn more, here is my weekly series to amplify tech and circular eco startups that are already paving inroads in this space.
