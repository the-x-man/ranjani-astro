What is the single most important thing to start your work day?

No, not with emails.

Take 15 mins to plan out your calendar for the day.

Here are three things to make sure you account for on your calendar

**#1Do** you have Deep Work slotted into the calendar to tackle the top 1-3 things you want to do for the day. Even if the rest of the day is off track, you can go to bed with a sense of achievement for the day.

**#2Can** you time-chunk tasks? : That means, slot in time to check emails and slack twice a day. You should own the notifications, not the other way around

**#3** Reduce Context Switching : Try to cluster the meetings to one part of the day. Highly recommend working in pomodoros.

One of the biggest reasons our to-do lists don’t get done is because

Intent doesn’t drive things

Action does.

And Action needs a defined time to do things.

How do you start your workday?
