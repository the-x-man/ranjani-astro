How fast is 5G?

With 3G, it takes forty-five minutes to download a high-definition movie.

4G shrinks that to twenty-one seconds.

But 5G?

It takes longer to read this sentence than it takes to download that movie.

In his latest book, Peter Diamandis, calls out 5G as one of the converging technologies that can disrupt the future.

5G, he says, will accelerate and deliver speeds that are a hundred times faster than what we currently experience at near-zero prices.

Fast and cheap always brings in adoption – and with it competition.

There are behemoths vying for real estate above our heads

Alphabet’s Project Loon, born out of Google X to replace terrestrial cell towers with stratospherically located balloons is now a reality.

Amazon joined the satellite competition in 2019 with Project Kuiper, a constellation of thousands of satellites designed to provide high speed broadband to the world

SpaceX has a 4 year head-start in providing global gigabit connections.

And finally, there is the David amongst all the Goliath’s – engineer Greg Wyler who is working on OneWeb to bring 5G to everyone.

> “Taken together, before the mid-point of the next decade, anyone who wants to be connected, will be connected” Peter Diamandis
