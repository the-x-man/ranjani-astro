The one where we talk about ‘How to Lead with Intent and Pay it forward’

[Preeti Chaudhary](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is quite a powerhouse.

She is a founder, mentor, venture partner, board member, speaker…

But most importantly an Inclusion ambassador. Here is her story and tips on how you can lead with intention.

“My maternal Grandfather – Late Pandit Bhawani Prasad Tiwari was

– A Freedom Fighter

– The VERY FIRST and subsequently 8 times Mayor of my city Jabalpur

– Twice Member Of Parliament from Raiya Sabha and a

– India’s 4th highest civilian award, Padmashri recipient

A family full of highly educated and accomplished women from ALL walks of professions – PhDs, college professors, doctors, architect, software professionals, teachers, musicians etc.

I have seen equity and inclusion, RIGHT at home, from the very beginning!

Add to that my own life principles of being the voice and giving visibility to the most marginalized, unrepresented and invisible people of our society and community – it is a no-brainer I started down the path of inclusion and enablement OF and FOR ALL – Women, Veterans, Persons With Disabilities, LGBT+

Wondering how YOU may further the cause of inclusion, as a person/professional?

Please consider becoming an ALLY!

How?

**#Understanding**/owning up our own privilege

**#Read** up, to get all the nuances right: info on our biases, pronouns and their use, policies, laws etc

**#Be** vocal: lend your voice and speak up in your own social circles

**#Listen** and learn from peoples’ stories

**#ASK** rather than assume anything at all!

**#LISTEN** not just hear!

Lastly, HELP out in whatever capacity you may: with your time, skills, teaching, awareness creation, connecting people, etc

Thank you for the encouragement, by acknowledging and highlighting a part of my story!”

It is my personal goal to help more women overcome the ‘broken rung’ and scale at their careers.
