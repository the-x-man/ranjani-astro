Becoming better – One thing I learnt in the last 3 months.

I made a couple of personal changes – started a Decision Log and focused on Deliberate Practice.

And this is what I have learnt

That I am not as good as I thought I was. Across areas – from Strategy, Leadership, Communication to Analytics.

Here are some ideas to get started

**#1** Start with keeping a log of decisions you take, why and how they have turned out. Identify your actions that caused a poor and good decision.

**#2** Seek feedback from people you work with around things that you should start-stop and continue. For example – I realize I most often skip the small talk and get to task solving unless I am conscious about it.

**#3** Identify problem use-cases around areas you want to improve on and talk out aloud/write down scenarios of how you would tackle it. Example – How should you handle working with ambiguity with specific examples.

**#4** Record yourself introducing yourself or explaining something to another person and listen to it. I have realized I tend to not just talk fast but also communicate too many things within a single conversation. Something that doesn’t make for impact.

**#5** Talk to people – Learning from people is something I have oft ignored in lieu of books. This is absolutely game changing.

So yes, while it is highly uncomfortable, challenging and questions my sense of self worth at times, I would rather identify and work on it than to stay in a blind-spot.

Do you have ideas or tips around how you have actively worked on improving yourself?
