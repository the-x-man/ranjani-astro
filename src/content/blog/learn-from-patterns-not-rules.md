Wake up 5AM vs at 9AM

Gold medalist vs ‘Academics doesn’t matter’

Reading 52 books vs Learn from doing than reading

Planning each day vs I like to wing it

Can’t finish 100 years of solitude vs I love Gabriel García Márquez

I constantly see such opposing views on my feed. One usually dissing the verity of the other.

There is no right or wrong way – they are all successful people

People. Contexts. Environment. Societies we live in.

Are all different.

With fewer opportunities vs supply, I had to do well in academics to differentiate self and get my first job.

I have stayed up until 12 with a colicky kid, feeling guilty about missing my 5AM meditation

Don’t let a stranger with a different life narrative define rules for you.

Learn from patterns of successful folks. Don’t blindly follow rules.

“Waking up at 5 AM” is a rule.

“Understand before being understood” is a pattern/mental model.

Learn the difference.

And do what works best for you.
