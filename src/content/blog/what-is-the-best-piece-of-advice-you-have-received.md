What is the best piece of advice you have received?

‘You are over-indexed on books . Make time to connect with people to learn more’

We were once discussing an article about how Adobe’s CEO, Shantanu Narayen relies on mentors forged through years of relationships for help in navigating everything

And one of the leaders I look up to mentioned the above comment.

“But I wish I had the time to connect to mentor networks”, I protested.

“Make the time is all I would say”, he repeated.

My parents had post graduate degrees in English literature and worked Government jobs – while they had all the intention to help me with growing in tech, they didn’t know enough.

So before I had mentors I turned to books. For everything I didn’t know.

But I thought about that comment oft.

I still have a way to go but over the last 6 months or so, I have connected with new folks almost every weekend.

Different sectors, age-cohorts and geographies.

On topics varying from tech, startups, fin-tech, neo-banking, women entrepreneurship, how to write a book, angel investing, leadership to financial literacy.

I have left every conversation feeling so humbled by how little I know.

Definitely not dropping books but learning from people’s experiences is amazing!

We usually stick to our comfort zones and people we work with.

You would be surprised at how many people are willing to help if you are open to learning.

Also, if you don’t ask, the answer is always no.

It is one of the advices that would definitely recommend to others too.

What is the best piece of advice you have received?
