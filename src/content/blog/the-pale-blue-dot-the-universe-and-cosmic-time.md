Have you read Carl Sagan’s Pale Blue Dot?

It references Earth’s appearance from space taken by Voyager in 1990

“Look again at that dot.

That’s here. That’s home. That’s us.

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.

The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

\[…\]

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.

To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.”

Again, this week is a historical moment.

We get to witness the first images from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope

Revealing unprecedented and detailed views of the universe.

Like this stellar image of the Carina Nebula that sheds light on how new stars are formed

It is one the most beautiful images I have ever seen – A human made this happen.

It is also a reminder of how transient our lives are in the context of the universe and cosmic time.

Or as Carl Sagan said “Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light”
