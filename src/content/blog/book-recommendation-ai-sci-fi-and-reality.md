So I read this Blake Frost’ Sci-Fi book over last weekend

It made me deeply uncomfortable – like most good stories that border on reality do

Black Mirror-esque, it explores man’s relationship with AI, ethics of ‘what is right’, sentience and free will.

A rudimentary AI that expands on a set of progressions, its relationship with its creator-developer, what it means for it to take a human form or go past singularity and sentience.

The state (and growth) of AI today feels much like the more you learn, the less you seem to know.

Fan of Sci-Fi as a genre? Check out the Blake Frost’s Summer Frost
