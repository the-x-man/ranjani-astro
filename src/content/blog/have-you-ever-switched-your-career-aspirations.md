I thought I wanted to work in Marketing and drive Go-to-market strategy in my first role.

As management trainees, we rotated across roles in the first year and I was assigned as the product manager to drive Product Usage and Retention for my State.

It involved number crunching day in and out – analyzing customer profiles, usage, segmentation, offer and ROI analysis.

Post the first year, we rotated into other roles

I lasted a whole 3 months in marketing before I badgered my boss to put me back with my numbers, analysis that helped drive the product roadmap and help take decisions

Most of the time, we assume we like something and want to do it.

Maybe because we see our peers doing it.

We hear about it

We hear it pays well

We think it sounds like a cool thing to do

I get a dozen messages each day with folks wanting to get into data sciences

Do you have a clear why?

A why that aligns with who you truly are.

Have you ever switched career aspirations?
