1. Why choose Data sciences – Why does it matter to you?
2. “Not all Data scientists are the same” – How do identifying areas that align to your strengths
3. Did you know? – Day in the life of a data scientist
4. Be an artist, not a painter
5. Create a portfolio
6. Making a transition or a break into the space as a beginner
7. Solve Problems
