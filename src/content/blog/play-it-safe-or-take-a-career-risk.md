Play it safe or take a Career Risk?

Growing up in an incentivized-for-performance environment that most Asian parents tend to fall into, I dreaded failure.

It meant I followed a straitjacketed path and avoided risks.

Like picking STEM or management courses I felt had better ROI over Culture and Communication or Semiotics.

Or picking an internship at the prestigious ISRO, only to focus on topping the class vs learning from the experience.

It is thus refreshing to see the new cohort of kids exploring unchartered territory even before they are out of college.

And risks doesn’t really always imply switching to entrepreneurship.

It could mean getting out of your career bubble and moving out of your silos at work.

Talking to people at work you usually may not interact with.

Being ok with doing something that isn’t your area of expertise.

Offering to help someone without really seeking something in return – great way to get mentors

Or, even, like in my case, prioritizing my family, and not dying with the guilt of taking a downtime.

Sometimes moving sideways may be the fastest way to move up

What is a career risk you have taken?
