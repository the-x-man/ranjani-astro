“Being able to feel safe with other people is probably the single most important aspect of mental health; safe connections are fundamental to meaningful and satisfying lives.”

Mental health isn’t something I took seriously

It is something I read about but didn’t reflect upon much.

Only when I got myself a coach and talked through what was on my mind did I realise how much I ignored my health in general – and brute force I was using to power through it all or the self criticism, isn’t self compassion.

I followed the Scarlett O’Hara rule – if you have read Gone with the Wind – ‘After all, tomorrow is another day’, putting away the important in lieu of the urgent.

The Body keeps Score is my 27th book of the year – and hands-down the best one I have read this year.

The researcher spent his career studying how children and adults adapt to traumatic experiences

He uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers’ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust.

He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain’s natural neuroplasticity.

If you are like I, who is extremely self critical and working on developing self compassion, I’d highly recommend this one
