On working with uncertainty, first principles and moonshot thinking

A former rocket scientist reveals the habits, ideas, and simple strategies you can use to make giant leaps in work and in life.

You do not need to be a rocket scientist to think like one – landing a dream job, learning a new skill or working in complex situations without clear guidelines, thinking like a rocket scientist, the author says is a necessity.

He calls out 9 different strategies in this book to make that leap.

It is filled with insights you can use in daily life – give it a read!
