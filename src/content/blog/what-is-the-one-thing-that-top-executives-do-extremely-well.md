What is the one thing that top executives do extremely well?

I once asked a senior women leader (I hugely admire) – “Where do you focus your personal energy as you grow as a leader?”

Pat came her answer, ” On Asking Good Questions”

At the outset this may seem surprising since we rise through the ranks ‘because we give good answers’ to problems.

We assume that as we grow, we do so linearly – do more of the same thing. Which isn’t necessarily true.

She mentioned how she trusts her team to execute and her role is not to monitor and project manage but to unblock her team.

Her take was that the top executives ask open exploratory questions to help their teams identify opportunities and explore new directions

“To get a great answer, you need to ask the perfect question”

Curious about what are some great questions that you have asked or have been asked in your careers?
