This person doesnâ€™t exist.

This image is created by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

â€“ essentially one that generates â€˜hyperrealistic fake images of people who do not existâ€™

While I believe AI can be used for good, it is also hugely crucial we understand and are informed about how the tech can be as dangerously misused as it is fascinating.

Also, it doesnâ€™t fail to strike me as to how none of the 25+ odd iterations I tried created a single person who looks similar someone like me.

Reiterating how it is as easy to pass on human biases to machines ðŸ™‚
