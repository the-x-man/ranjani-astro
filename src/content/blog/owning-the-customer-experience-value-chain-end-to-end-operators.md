Owning the Customer Experience Value Chain – End to End Operators

Do you remember contacting people with Yellow Pages?

This evolved further where you could find a carpenter online but the process of contacting them remained largely offline.

Then came the marketplaces that allows the transactions to occur online.

[Battery Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) has this brilliant article where they talk about this phenomenon where more start-ups are ‘full stack’ in delivering customer experiences from the ground up.

Or as they call it, ‘End to End Operators’

By owning the complete value chain they create

**#Better** functional customer experience, cheaper and faster

**#Owning** operations stack allows better control over quality, service or pricing

**#Is** it for everyone? Maybe not. These end-to-end models require more capital to scale than narrowly focused startups though have a net positive ROI in the long run

The first example that struck me when I was reading this was Tesla.

Most of these have gone ahead to disrupt the incumbents in the sector.

Can you think of startup examples in the India market, owning and reinventing customer experience, end to end?
