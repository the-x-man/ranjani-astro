What are the Time-twisting, Mind-bending and Craziest books you have read in your life?

Imagine you woke up one morning and discovered that your entire life – your job, your kids, your friends, all your experiences – wasn’t real.

It still feels real. You remember it vividly. But you also suddenly remember another life; your real life. 

Are we really happy? What if we made different decisions in life?

What if we could live out choices we never made but wished we did?

Very few books have this mind-bending quality to them – have you sit up until 2 AM in the morning or make you feel tiny and overwhelmed.

It resonates with life’s big ‘what-if’ questions one asks self the night before one graduates out of college or before a huge life event

I discovered Blake Crouch’s novels this week, during my time off

And then stay through the emotionally charged ride over the 2 days it took to finish the two novels.

Be it the quantum fiction, multi-verses posited on Schrödinger’s cat in Dark Matter or the Neuroscience behind time travel, memory and death in Recursion – it is reads like Black Mirror in text.

Intense, Convoluted and Unputdownable

“Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards”
