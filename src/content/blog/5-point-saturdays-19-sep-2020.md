Hi All!

Here is your weekly dose of “5 Point Saturdays,” – interesting tidbits from what I have been Reading: Latest reviews, Books, Weekly challenges, Learning Hacks, and More!

What am I reading

[Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That Will Improve and/or Ruin Everything ](https://www.amazon.in/Soonish-Emerging-Technologies-Improve-Everything/dp/B0764LK7NZ/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dchild=1&keywords=Soonish&qid=1600505492&sr=8-1)

What will the world of tomorrow be like? How does progress happen? And why do we not have a lunar colony already?

In this book, the authors give us a snapshot of the transformative technologies that are coming next – from robot swarms to nuclear fusion powered-toasters – and explain how they will change our world in astonishing ways. By weaving together their own research and interviews with pioneering scientists, they investigate why these innovations are needed, how they would work, and what is standing in their way. 

What did I learn new?

In the movie Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khans, a fascinating new technology called Genesis Device was introduced. It was capable of transforming dead planets into lush, livable worlds almost instantly. It would explode like a bomb and release a spray of highly bioengineered DNA. As this super DNA spreads to all corners of the planet, the cells would take root and dense jungles would form until the entire planet is terraformed within a matter of days. 

In 2016, there was a paper published detailing what a real life Genesis device might look like. The professor predicts that a primitive version would be possible in 50 to 100 years.

This is an excerpt from the book – Future of Humanity on terraforming Mars and building a destiny for humanity beyond earth. It is an exciting time to be alive.

Productivity Hack I am trying out

You might have heard of [Bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/about) \[oft called the ‘Konmari for your racing thoughts’\] – which is described as a mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity system. It’s designed to help you organize your what while you remain mindful of your why.

I recently set up Trello boards for daily, weekly and monthly logs to help out with Bullet journalling online. Tremendously useful!

Here is a link that helped – [How to Use a Bullet Journal in Trello to Plan Your Day](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-bullet-journal-trello-plan-day/#:~:text=With%20your%20Trello%20boards%20all,Daily%20Logs%20ahead%20of%20time.)

Movie I highly recommend

I hardly watch TV. I don’t trust my will power enough to stay away from the constantly streaming media doling out series and latest movies so I don’t subscribe to them.

But this one came so highly recommended that I made an exception to the no-movie rule. 

I am reading Creativity Inc by Pixar’s co-founder Ed Catmull which spoke about the making of this movie – ‘Inside Out’.

What a solid movie. Absolutely brilliant. Do watch.

Here is the trailer link – [Inside Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seMwpP0yeu4)

Poetry that I am ruminating about –

**If you forget me – Pablo Neruda**

> “Well, now,  
> if little by little you stop loving me  
> I shall stop loving you little by little.  
> If suddenly  
> you forget me  
> do not look for me,  
> for I shall already have forgotten you.”
