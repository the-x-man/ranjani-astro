I’ve been doing this online course from Stanford on ‘[Leading Innovation](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xine229-leading-innovation)‘ which has some really interesting interviews.

As part of the module that talks about the differences between creative and routine work, the professor introduces IDEO’s former partner [Diego Rodriguez](https://twitter.com/metacool?lang=en) and his 21 principles for Innovation.

The 19th principle is to ‘Be remarkable’.

This is quite relevant to not just organizations but also to individuals – so I created a PDF version of the 21 principles that you can download for free here.
