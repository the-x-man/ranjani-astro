The startup that creates Carbon tiles out of Polluted Air

Gurgaon’s air quality index today is 387 AQI.

The ideal range for human life quality is between 0-50.

Is that the inheritance we want to leave our children with?

As part of my **#TheGoodFund** research of socially impactful tech start-ups, I recently stumbled upon the Clean-tech startup, [CarbonCraft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)

The founder, [Tejas Sidnal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), “was keen to create an architectural intervention to up-cycle pollution, one that can be achieved through technology and craft”

“The startup, which was officially founded in January 2019, is working in collaboration with Air-Ink, a Boston-based startup that is processing the air pollutants and providing them with the soot to use in their innovation”

The soot is infused with materials like marble chips, marble powder, cement along with a proprietary binder

An article state that, ‘Handmade by traditional craftsmen, each one of these carbon tiles equals cleaning 30,000 litres of polluted air. That’s one full day’s worth of clean air per person!”

Beyond everything else, what appealed to me was their story and the fundamental question all of us should ask ourselves –

“Everything in nature has a functional purpose and there is no wastage. Then why do humans have so much waste?

“Using air pollution as a resource in the model of a circular economy just as everything in the forest comes a full circle; that was the philosophy that led to their start-up”

Know of a tech startup driving social impact, especially backed by women? drop me a note or tag them here 🙂

My hope is, at some point in the future, to start a VC fund directed at **#StartupsforSocialImpact** – **#TheGoodFund**

Towards that, as I learn more, here is my weekly series to amplify tech and circular eco startups that are already paving inroads in this space.
