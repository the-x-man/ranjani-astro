Two Women who break stereotypes. One, a Spy.

And Two World Wars between them.

Based on the enthralling historical account of the ‘queen of spies’, French secret agent who went by the Pseudonym, Alice Dubois ended up running a network of 100+ agents

The book takes creative liberty with new characters entwined within this and parallel narratives from 1947 and 1915

I absolutely loved the authenticity and depth in the 1915 characters that are missing in the other.

What a fabulous read for anyone who is interested in historical fiction.

“There are two kinds of flowers when it comes to women,” Eve said. “The kind that sit safe in a beautiful vase, or the kind that survive in any conditions . . . even in evil. Lili was the latter. Which are you?”
