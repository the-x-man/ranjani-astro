Are you indispensable at work?

There is a village in China – outside of Shenzen called Dafen.

It is said that 60% of new oil paintings worldwide was produced here.

The workers in Dafen – while diligent and talented aren’t artists – they are painters.

Cogs in a painting machine.

The author, Seth Godin, talks about 2 paintings he owns from Dafen for 60 USD each.

Who knows which Dafen resident painted them – no one.

Who cares – no one.

The painters are replaceable.

This is becoming more essential in order to survive in the workplace

Because the days of being a cog in the wheel are over

“The job is what you do when you are told what to do. The job is showing up at the factory, following instructions, meeting spec, and being managed.

Someone can always do your job a little better or faster or cheaper than you can.

The job might be difficult, it might require skill, but it’s a job.

Your art is what you do when no one can tell you exactly how to do it. Your art is the act of taking personal responsibility, challenging the status quo, and changing people”

Be an artist. Not a painter.

Book recommendation : Linchpin, Seth Godin
