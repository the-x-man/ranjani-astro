“…It’s interesting that if you ask people 10 years ago about how AI was going to have an impact, … you would’ve heard, first,

it’s going to come for the blue collar jobs working in the factories, truck drivers, whatever.

Then it will come for the low skill white collar jobs.

Then the very high skill, really high IQ white collar jobs, like a programmer or whatever.

And then very last of all and maybe never, it’s going to take the creative jobs. And it’s going exactly the other direction” – Sam Altman

🤖 Here are other key take-aways from OpenAI’s Sam Altman’s episode on the New Frontiers of AI with GreyMatter Podcasts

🔍 Focus on the middle layer: One important area of focus in AI is the “middle layer,” or the layer between data and applications. This layer is important for making sense of data and translating it into actionable insights.

🤝 Alignment and self-improvement: Another important consideration in AI is ensuring that AI systems are aligned with human values and goals. Additionally, self-improvement is important for AI systems to continue to learn and grow over time.

🌙 Moonshots: As with any new technology, there are many moonshot ideas being explored in the AI field. These ideas may seem crazy or impossible now, but they could have a big impact in the future.

💡 Applications of AI: One exciting trend in AI is the decreasing cost of both energy and intelligence. This means that AI is becoming more accessible and can be applied to a wider range of problems.

🌐 Metaverse and AI: The concept of the metaverse is becoming increasingly popular, and AI will likely play a big role in shaping the future of the metaverse.

🚫 What won’t change with AI: While AI will bring many changes to our world, some things will remain the same. For example, human creativity and emotions are not likely to be fully replaced by AI.

The field has evolved a lot in a short amount of time, and it will continue to do so in the years ahead.
