In 2020, I started on this journey to learn to tell better stories.  
  
From one of the best design and innovation organizations – [IDEO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ideo/)  
  
Across these weeks, we have had the opportunity to work with fabulous coaches and a cohort of highly creative people from around the world  
  
Identifying the story that I want to tell, to change the world  
– one sticky note at a time.  
  
From developing a blueprint into storytelling prototypes and finally bringing the story to life  
  
I realized how difficult it is to pare down the numbers and make it personal and emotional.  
  
How it takes multiple iterations to simplify – and then some more.  
  
To finally come up with a narrative \[which is for another post\]
