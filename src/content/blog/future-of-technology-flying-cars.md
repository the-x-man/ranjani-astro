“Uber’s goal is to demonstrate flying car capability in 2020 and have aerial ride sharing fully operational in Dallas and LA by 2023”

#FlyingCars

1. US is home to 10 of the world’s 25 most congested cities costing $300 billion in lost income/productivity
2. Aerial ride sharing may sound like sci-fi but by mid-2019, over 1 billion USD had been invested in at least 25 different flying car companies.
3. Alphabet, Google’ s parent company, was amongst the first to recognize the potential and has personally funded Zee Aero, Opener and Kitty Hawk
4. The marginal cost of car ownership today is 59 cents per passenger mile \[It is $8.93/mile for a helicopter\]. Uber’s long term target is a game-changer at 44 cents/mile – cheaper than the cost of driving.
5. eVTOLS’ – electric Vertical Take-off and Landing vehicles\] are being developed by a number of companies. Uber is also partnering with NASA to develop air traffic management system & design ‘mega-skyports’

By 2030, urban aviation could be a major mode of getting from point A to B.

The flying cars promised by Jetsons’ seems to be here.
