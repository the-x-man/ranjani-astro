Sometimes it may feel like nothing is really the way it should be.

Or that there is no progress.

One of the books I read had a great rule to add perspective –

The 10–10–10 rule makes long-term thinking easy and practical. … Think not only about how you feel in the moment, but also ten minutes, ten months, and ten years from now. Then decide.

If isn’t something that you would be ashamed about 10 years from now – don’t let it kill you today. .

Zoom out to add perspective.
