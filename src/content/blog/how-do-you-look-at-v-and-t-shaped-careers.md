“I am 2 years into my first tech job and in a generalist role.

I see my peers in specialist roles such as software engineering or testing.

Should I be worried about losing out on depth of experience?”

Some young folks astound you.

Like this young 25 year old girl we spoke to recently in our mentoring session.

Incredibly self aware, she was playing multiple roles in her corporate role – from PM to Marketing and Program Management and was worried about whether she was in the right direction.

In today’s **#CoffeeChat**, [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I talk about about T and V shaped careers in Tech

And how you approach Generalist and Specialist roles.

[Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I share a passion for mentoring mid management folks to scale into leadership roles. Find time to chat with us here
