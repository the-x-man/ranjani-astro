I am writing a book.

There, I said it.

The first book agent I met called out that I wasn’t a celebrity

‘Why will people want to buy what you write?”, he asked.

That is fair. I don’t know.

But more than any external factor, the one thing that holds folks back is themselves.

We are harshly critical of ourselves. At least, I am.

I tend to think of ways in which I could have done things differently after every meeting.

And for the longest time, I felt like I needed permission.

From someone.

For me to do things I loved to do.

Until I realised I would want to write even if no one ever read it.

So well, I don’t have a finalised publisher. I don’t have a final draft.

I even need to align on the themes with my co-author and finally find the time to do so.

But they are solvable problems.

The one that took the longest though was to convince myself

What are the dreams that you are awaiting external validation to start?
