Company first – Business Unit Next – Team Third – Individual Last

Always. Always think in that order.

If you are a working individual solving a problem, always put the company hat first when you think through the solution

If you are a hiring manager, please hire for folks with this outlook.

If you are start-up, establish this culture from the outset.

If you are a business leader, remember that your team will follow the precedent you set.

I recall reading the company-first narrative somewhere and it has stuck with me since.

One of the core reasons for gaps in execution is when teams that work together do not adopt this mindset.

A process or platform is a means of getting to the end goal and not the end goal in itself

The end goal always is (and should be) driving business value and creating an exceptional experience for the customers of your company.
