The job of a data scientist is to not just build models to predict which customers churn. Or dashboards to show KPIs around it.

The job of a data engineering team is not just to enable data from multiple sources.

Analytics and Engineering should actually help reduce churn.

Completing a task isn’t success. Driving impact is.

“A company’s ability to compete is measured by how successfully it applies analytics to vast, unstructured data sets across disparate sources to drive product innovation”

That takes huge transformation across people, processes and culture.

Have you been part of such a transformation? What has helped you drive value from analytics and data teams?
