“When the Black Death plague entered England in 1348, the Scots up north laughed at their good fortune.

With the English crippled by disease, now was a perfect time for Scotland to stage an attack on its neighbor.

The Scots huddled together thousands of troops in preparation for battle. Which, of course, is the worst possible move during a pandemic.
