In a majority of cases being an expert at Python or SQL alone doesn’t help.

Driving value with data isn’t about tools or code alone.

And this is an area I oft find as a huge gap.

– Can you convert an output to an outcome?

– Are you looking at the relevance of the attributes you choose for the model in the user journey?

– Do you understand what the end stakeholders want and can translate it into a technical solution

– Can you work with ambiguity and use data to help drive roadmap vs waiting for the PM to tell you want is to be done?

– Can you be the data steward who can help identify gaps and opportunities to drive product strategy?

– Can you work with cross functional teams to influence decisions

– Can you prioritize your actions based on ROI of your decisions

You may not necessarily start with all these skills but working towards them is critical.

A sure-shot path to failure is to ignore them – especially as you grow in your career.

As Seth Godin puts it, if all you is code as well as another, there is always someone cheaper to replace you. Or tech that would make you redundant

Are you building a unique skill stack?
