Aiming to be a Zero

(And when you should be a Plus one)

“Whenever you enter a new situation, whether this is a rocket ship or a meeting room or even a fresh personal relationship, you will be viewed as one of three things. “

A Minus One – actively harmful, someone who creates problems.

A Zero – your impact is neutral and doesn’t tip the balance one way or another

A Plus One – someone who actively adds value.

– Chris Hadfield, Canadian Astronaut and Spaceship Commander

We all want to be a Plus One. I have been guilty of it too.

Chris talks about how at first, on a new team or in a new situation, his main goal is to avoid being a net negative contributor. Rather, he seeks to be a “zero.”

But by entering the environment, relationship or meeting room and proclaiming yourself to be a Plus One, you are almost certainly singling yourself out as a Minus One right away.

That’s regardless of the skills and life experiences you may be bringing.

Instead, win their confidence and trust by being a zero.

This means pulling your weight, humbly showing up, not trying to be in the spotlight, doing your job professionally, asking questions, and learning the ropes.

In time you will earn people’s respect and can move from zero to plus contributor and someone that others will want to follow.

This may be the longer play, but it’s far more effective to winning confidence in the long run.

Instead, aim to be a Zero in every new situation. Even if everyone knows that you’re the Plus One.

This is some great advice —be a zero, not a hero.
