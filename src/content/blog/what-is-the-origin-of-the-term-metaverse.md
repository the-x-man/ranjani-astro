What is the origin of the term Metaverse?

Have you read of Snowcrash?

It’s one of Naval’s recommended readings. A 1992 science fiction novel by Neal Stephenson’s 1992 first coined the term – Metaverse

It was used to describe a place where humans, as avatars, interact with each other and software agents, in a three-dimensional virtual space that uses the metaphor of the real world.

Stephenson used the term to describe a virtual reality-based successor to the Internet.

The concept of the metaverse has quickly become a buzzword in technology and business. Something that has accelerated in the post COVID world.

Where will you display the most expensive non-fungible token (NFT) artwork ever bought?

The $69 M NFT-backed digital artwork bought by Metakovan is planned to be displayed in a virtual monument called ‘The Souk’ that they’re building in a virtual, online world.

Interesting times we live in. Thoughts?
