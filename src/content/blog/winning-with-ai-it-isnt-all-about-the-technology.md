Let’s see if we can use an analogy here.

We all need a shiny new car. One that accelerates to 60mph in 6 seconds. Why not add IoT – automatic alerts while at it too.

Voice assistant enabled chargers, anyone?…….

No one – Do we have the requisite people, process, and tech for this car to actually run?

The analyst – You know what, this tire up in the front left – doesn’t seem to match with the one on the right.

Good data is a hygiene factor. Much like one’s salary.

You don’t stay at a job for the pay alone but the absence of it will lead to impacting satisfaction and performance.

Investing in a good data strategy AND implementation is foundational to driving any success and winning with AI.

“Invest in AI talent, data, and process change in addition to (and often more so than) AI technology.

Companies that do well, recognize that AI is not all about technology.”
