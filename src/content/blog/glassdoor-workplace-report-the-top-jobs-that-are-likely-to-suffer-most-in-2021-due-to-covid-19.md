Glassdoor released a Workplace trends report 2021 yesterday  
  
Will COVID-19 have a lasting impact on hiring and workplace culture in 2021 and beyond?  
  
One of the trends they identified – The COVID-19 recession is probably over, but these jobs may never return  
  
“As the global pandemic shifts, consumer behavior and workplace habits, certain jobs like audiologists, executive assistants, and coaches may not return en masse for years, if ever,” according to Glassdoor’s chief economist, Dr. Andew Chamberlain.
