[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) can, at times, be quite a microcosm – representing not the world as is but the world we usually interact with.

“Can you help my daughter find a job as a nanny”, my cook asked me last week.

I looked up from what I was reading. “I can check in the apartment groups if anyone is looking. Has she worked as a nanny before?”, I asked.

“No akka (sister, in Kannada). She used to do a ‘big job’ in a ‘big hospital’ as a peon earning almost 20K INR (\~250 USD)/month. But she has left that job now”

Why so, was my first thought. After much discussion I learnt that her son-in-law asked her daughter to resign.

Why? Because he once visited and saw that her role required her talking to ‘strange men’ – something ‘he wasn’t comfortable with her doing’.

Here was a woman trying to be independent, having to now look for another job because her spouse had insecurities

Beyond crashing her dreams, think about the implications to their kids’ and their education – something that additional income could have helped.

It is a downward spiral.

Overcoming the income gap within a generation has become increasingly harder.

Generational wealth feeds the trope of rich becoming richer.

Education is singularly the driver that can help bridges that gap.

And beyond it all, while I can continue to talk about my rights as a woman or the lack of it, there are a multitude of worlds around us where the concept of rights doesn’t even exist.

So here is reminding myself that the world isn’t just what I see around me. And the privilege and thereby responsibility each of us hold for fellow humans around us 🙂
