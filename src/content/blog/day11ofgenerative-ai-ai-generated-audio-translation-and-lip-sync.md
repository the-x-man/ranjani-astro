This is an AI generated audio translation + lip sync from English to Hindi.

I don’t completely understand what I am saying but it is impressive how far we have come.

While the syncing can be improved, whats more impressive is that it is from a Generative AI for Media startup incubated right here in India by a couple of sharp guys from IIT Madras.

Very pumped about the Building from India. For the World.

There are decades when nothing happens. And weeks when decades happen.

Excited for you on the journey, [Pavan Reddy](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

What are the best use cases you have come across with Generative AI?
