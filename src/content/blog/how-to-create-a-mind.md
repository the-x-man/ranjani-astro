> Outer space is not the final frontier, our Brain is.

Reverse engineering the human brain may be regarded as the most important project in history.

Is the brain complex? 

In his book, Ray Kurzweil introduces the concept of \*pattern recognition theory of mind\*. (PRTM).

He further draws an analogy to the famous Mandelbrot set, an image that is a symbol of complexity yet it is just a simple 6 character formula applied iteratively.

 To begin with – despite the richness and complexity of human thought-Kurzweil argues that the underlying principles and neuro-networks that are responsible for higher-order thinking are actually relatively simple, and in fact fully replicable.

Indeed, for Kurzweil, our most sophisticated AI machines are already beginning to employ the same principles and are mimicking the same neuro-structures that are present in the human brain.

 I wonder though if the total is bigger than the sum of its parts. 

How does one demystify consciousness and qualia (subjective experiences – “Is my red same as your red? “)

 As always, there are no right answers, but that shouldn’t stop us from asking the right questions. 

Cogito Ergo Sum!
