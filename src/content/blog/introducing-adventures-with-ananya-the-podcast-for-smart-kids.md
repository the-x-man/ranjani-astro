Here is the the bi-weekly line-up of the first 9 episodes of the morning podcast that I co-host with my bubbly 5.5 year old!

The one who never stops asking why!

Adventures with Ananya!

Suitable age – 4 to 8 years

Also, a special note from A : ‘Please tell them that ‘Ananya doesn’t make podcasts on Saturdays and Sundays, so don’t wait for it’

I know it isn’t professionally made but we have so much fun doing this together!

If you happen to have an equally curious kid, follow us on Spotify at ‘Adventures with Ananya’!
