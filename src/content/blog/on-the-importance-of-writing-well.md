In a remote-first world, writing well is but an essential skill.

If I were to pick skills for ‘deliberate practice’, learning to communicate well would top the list

Writing clearly and concisely means choosing your words deliberately – to get your point across to the audience.

Here is George Orwell’s \[yes, 1984 \] Six rules for writing clearly

**#Rule1**. “Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.” – skip the cliched phrases

**#Rule2**. “Never use a long word where a short one will do.”

\[“due to the fact that” = Because\]

**#Rule3**. “If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.”

**#Rule4**. “Never use the passive where you can use the active.”

\[I made a mistake. vs Mistakes were made\]

**#Rule5.** “Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.”

**#Rule6**. “Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.”

Those who care about clarity of thought and responsible use of rhetoric would do well to consult or re-read, [Orwell’s essay ](https://lhsblogs.typepad.com/files/george-orwell-on-writing.pdf)

I have since focused on avoiding the annoying buzzwords – i.e. – synergy, paradigm shift, disruption..

Which of the rules do you find most effective?
