This story reflects so much that is true.

Taking a bet on yourself is hard. Maybe for all.

But definitely so for a woman

Especially if you are raised in a culture that values topping the classes and fearing failure.

I see this in how I function too â€“ it is extremely hard for me to disappoint my parents â€“ even today. It is a constant battle between what I want vs what my family needs.

Kudos to [Suneera Madhani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) for beating the odds.

Even today, less than 3% of VC funding is directed at women led startups

Representative matters â€“ maybe my daughter would be braver than I am ðŸ™‚
