There are only 3 books that have made me cry

This one tops the list.

Ever so often, when I am overwhelmed with the world around me, I pause to think of the worst case scenario.

And realise I have already been in one.

Watching a loved one pass away, feeling helpless and distraught isn’t something I would wish on anyone.

But that moment stays etched within you through eternity – muttering under one’s breath to make them proud even as you see them slipping away.

It is a void that never really goes away.

But death, puts living into perspective. And is a reminder of what truly matters.

“There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.” – Paul Kalanithi, When Breath Becomes Air
