My sweet mom, who worked and retired at a government job for 35 odd years, once asked, “Ammu, all these unicorns you keep talking about – do they actually make 1Bn rupees of money?’

“It’s valued in USD, amma, not INR”, I replied.

“Oh!’, she exclaimed and then started to multiply with 75, as just moms can do 🙂

There were Unicorns (valued at US $1 Billion), Decacorns (>US $10 Billion), and now ‘Soonicorns’

MINT listed 22 startups that are waiting to become unicorns in 2022 in India (VC circle report) as ‘soonicorns’ ( Raised >500 million, but less than $1billion). The country is projected to have more than 100 unicorns in the next couple of years.

Which one of these is your bet on?
