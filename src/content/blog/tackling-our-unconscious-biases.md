The husband and I were changing into non-marking shoes right outside of our Tennis court last week.

When this elderly gentleman who was playing the earlier set walks out. He looks at me and then points out the set of rules nearby

Reading it out loud, almost as if I were a child.

Calling out the fact that anyone who is not playing or practising with the kids should do so in the adjacent practice court.

“Those who aren’t playing shouldn’t use this one’, he proclaims.

“And why would you think I am not the one playing?”, I ask him looking squarely in the eye.

The husband is right beside me – yet he isn’t questioned.

The small things matter.

It doesn’t fail to astound me how many times we are stereotyped and cast into neat little boxes.

Of me being the plus one

Of being asked to talk to my dad or husband about MY finances

Or addressing the brother because I might not ‘be interested in tech’

Yes, we are evolving and yes, I am better off today than my working mom was decades ago.

But we can do better.

As one of our training put it, please pay more attention to our unconscious biases.

Microaggressions aren’t ok.
