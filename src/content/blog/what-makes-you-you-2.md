𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂, 𝘆𝗼𝘂? 𝗟𝗲𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗼𝗳 ‘𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗼𝗳 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲𝘂𝘀’

Imagine that you went on a long journey on the sea

Across the years, you end up having to replace or repair the broken parts of the ship.

So much so that when you sail back home, every single component has been replaced – Is the ship then the same as the original one you sailed away with?

Now, imagine another scenario

You are sailing with a brand new ship and end up in a ship wreck

You end up rebuilding a similar ship – Now, is this the same as the original ship?

The ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus’ paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.

The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same ship.

As we increasingly move towards brain-machine interfacing, I wonder what makes us, truly us – what happens when we are AI augmented?

Will that spur a new hierarchy of haves vs have nots?

I am currently reading this sci-fi – ‘Mickey 7’

The basic premise is simple – the protagonist is an ‘expendable’ recruited on dangerous intergalactic missions

One that is biologically recreated – that is, after one iteration dies, a new body is regenerated with most of his memories intact. 

“If I die, you can always make another me”, he says.

The thing with Sci-Fi is – unlike most fiction, these are akin to thought experiments – what if questions that man (or woman) tends to ask

Until it is true.

I don’t know the answer to if Mickey 8 is the same as Mickey 7

Because, it is truly a difficult question to answer – What makes us, us?
