“Never Trust. Always Verify” – The evolving Zero Trust Model

A recent IBM-sponsored study demonstrated that the average cost of a single data breach is over $3 million.

One of the latest buzzwords around Cybersecurity is ‘Zero Trust’

What does it mean? And why should you know about it?

Unlike the past where data resides in corporate datacenters, today it resides across locations and devices.

Zero trust is based on the concept of ‘Never trust, always verify’.

As opposed to Traditional IT network security is based on the castle-and-moat approach – where it is hard to obtain access from outside the network, but everyone inside the network is trusted by default.

The problem with this approach is that once an attacker gains access to the network, they have free rein over everything inside.

Zero Trust was created by John Kindervag, during his tenure as a vice president at Forrester Research, based on the realization that traditional security models operate on the outdated assumption that everything inside an organization’s network should be trusted.

The Zero Trust model recognizes that trust is a vulnerability.

Zero trust security requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network

Regardless of whether they are sitting within or outside of the network perimeter.

The core principles include giving users-only as much access as needed, micro segmentation (breaking down security into smaller zones) and multi-factor authentication.

For AI/ML, Zero Trust ensures that sensitive data residing on the cloud can only be accessed by data scientists that are both authenticated and authorized to work with critical sensitive data.
