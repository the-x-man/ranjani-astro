What makes you passionate?

I was chatting with this newly minted CEO of a heath tech start up over the weekend.

He had, in the past, played executive roles and had moved onto investment and consulting.

His new startup leverages AI to automate manual work in healthcare and clinical trials. He spoke in depth about the leveraging tech for good and the impact to patients and clinicians.

I smiled at his enthusiasm and asked, ‘So, do you have a background or degree in biosciences?’

He grinned and stated, ‘Not really. I can get passionate about things I want to learn very quickly’.

That, I believe is an essential trait of those who do exceptionally well at their careers – being able to self learn.

In this age, where there is no dearth of information, context or reach -having the focus to be an autodidact –   **person who teaches himself or herself, rather than being taught by a teacher, is the ultimate super power.**

What have you learnt by yourself in the last 6 months?
