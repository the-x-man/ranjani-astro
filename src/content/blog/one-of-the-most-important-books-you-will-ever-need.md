I read close to 50 books this year.

Here is one I absolutely recommend

“One of the most important books you’ll ever read.”

Its not just another book on longevity – but one that that focusses “on living better and longer that challenges the conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary physician and leading longevity expert”

Peter Attia perfectly frames the iterations of our healthcare system – 1.0, 2.0, and now 3.0.

He introduces the concept of Medicine 3.0 that consists of 5 broad domains.

1\. Exercise

2\. Nutrition

3\. Sleep

4\. Emotional health

5\. Exogenous Modules (Drugs, hormones, or supplements)

It focusses much on solving for root causes vs symptoms – “There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in”

“..the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that I call the Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction.

To achieve longevity—to live longer and live better for longer—we must understand and confront these causes of slow death.”

I lost my dad at 62 and aware that genetics isn’t on my side – it explains me obsession with healthy eating

The good news though is genetic disposition is only part of the solve – your environment is as much a function of your longevity

“The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance—it is the illusion of knowledge. —Daniel J. Boorstin

We deserve to understand better about how we treat the greatest intrument we will ever own – our bodies
