What do you do when people you manage fail?

1. You forgive and forget
2. You remember, pass blame, stigmatize and humiliate them
3. You forgive and remember

The right approach that [Bob Sutton](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Professor of Management at [Stanford University](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) advocates is to \*forgive\* so that people have psychological safety and \*remember\*, so that you can learn, the person can learn and the organization can learn

I recently completed this course from Stanford on ‘Leading Innovation’ led by Robert Sutton on this topic that I highly recommend

The bottom-line remains this – There can be no innovation or learning without failure. Failure sucks but Instructs

One thing we tell every new hire on the team is this –

Try – Iterate- Learn- Improve- Do Better.

‘We have a strategic plan – its called doing things’

Are you providing your teams with psychological safety to succeed?
