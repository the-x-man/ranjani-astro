What do you do when people you manage fail?

1) You forgive and forget

2) You remember, pass blame, stigmatise and humiliate them

3) You forgive and remember

The right approach that [Bob Sutton](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Professor of Management at Stanford University advocates is to \*forgive\* so that people have psychological safety and \*remember\*, so that you can learn, the person can learn and the organisation can learn

This was part of a course from Stanford on ‘Leading Innovation’ led by Robert Sutton that I highly recommend

The bottom line is this

There can be no innovation or learning without failure.

‘Failure sucks but Instructs’

(This deserves a sticky note at the desk!)

One thing that has helped us become better as a team over time is this –

Try – Iterate- Learn- Improve- Do Better.

> “We have a strategic plan – its called doing things”

Are you providing your teams with psychological safety to succeed?
