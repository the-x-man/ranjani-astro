[OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s Dev Day demos are great examples where the Gen AI industry is heading

A famous line goes, ‘You don’t need a 7 inch nail but a 7 inch hole’

This is going to manifest itself in how AI is going to get consumed – you aren’t just researching for birthday themes – your need is to throw a fabulous birthday party

And with Agents, Generative AI gets closer to solve the need vs sell a particular outcome

This slick demo shows OpenAI’s head of developer experience demo Assistive AI which leverages natural language as an interface to explore and plan out a vacation

Integrating with code intepreter, retrieval and function calling it steps through the actions it is taking.

Assistive AI acts a precursor to agents

Imagine the use cases especially in Healthcare and Education where agents could democratise tech capabilities across masses with limited access

The future is coming in faster than you think
