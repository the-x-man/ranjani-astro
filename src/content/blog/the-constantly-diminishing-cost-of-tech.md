The Constantly Diminishing Cost of Tech

And how we take it for granted.

I was telling my 6 year old about sifting through Encyclopedias to finish school projects

She turned around and asked – ‘Why didn’t you just ask Alexa, Amma’.

For a moment I recollected the trips to the store to buy floppy disks, the 100 free SMS/day limit I raced to finish and all the times my grand mom made me buy stamps and ask for letters at the post office.

“In the last century we have seen an amazing increase of affordability of a wide variety of goods, including food…. According to Peter Diamandis the average cost of food today is 13 times less than it was a century ago.”

The graphic below shows the cost per kilogram for space launches across the globe since 1960.

Today, a SpaceX rocket launching can be 97% cheaper than a Russian Soyuz ride cost in the ’60s.

So while I am astounded each day with the quality and speed with which I can get stuff delivered home each day – freeing up time for my to do what I love, I am deeply grateful to tech.

Whilst trying hard to ensure that the instant gratification doesn’t make my daughter detached from the joy of anticipation 🙂

“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
