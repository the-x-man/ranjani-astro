Play the odds to your favour. Always.

There are a handful of messages I get from strangers on LinkedIn each day.

A majority of them drop a Hi and leave it at that. Others ask for what open roles are present in analytics. Some ask for how they can find a job. Some don’t follow-through on threads they initiate.

Only around 1 % of them take the effort to look at the careers page, review their skillset against relevant roles and ask specific questions.

“Here is the research I have done. These are the most suitable roles I have found. Here are the gaps that I see that I am working towards. Do you see them as dealbreakers? If not, could you refer me to them?”

9 out of 10 times I refer them to it.

Increasing your luck involves doing what the majority aren’t doing. Over and over.

In life, play the odds to your favour. Intentionally.
