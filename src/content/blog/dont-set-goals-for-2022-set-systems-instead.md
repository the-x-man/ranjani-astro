Don’t set goals for 2022!

Set Systems instead

The man behind the Dilbert series, Scott Adams puts his success down to an alternative approach to goal setting.

Setting systems vs goals

“The Problem with goals is that they give you something to work toward, but accomplishments are fleeting.

What’s more, if the goal is particularly difficult to achieve, working on it without seeing tangible progress induces feelings of stress. You also might not be able to control the outcome of a goal.

For example, an executive could set a goal of becoming a manager within a business only for the company to rearrange itself due to financial cutbacks and reduce the number of managerial roles.

This puts achieving the goal in question beyond the executive’s reach, at least in the short- and medium-term.”

Systems are a lot like habits in that they represent things you do consistently.

Example

Goal: Lose weight.

System: Run for 30 minutes a day at 7 AM, buy smaller plates, and drink 64 oz of water each day.

Goal: Read 50 books per year.

System: Spend one hour reading each night before bed….

Focus on the process. Results will follow.
