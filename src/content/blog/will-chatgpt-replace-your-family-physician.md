Will ChatGPT replace your family doctor?

With a high risk pregnancy, I singularly attribute getting out of it alive to my physicians and the medical care I had available.

But then, I had the privilege of having a slew of specialists who were there to help – a factor that is non-existed for a large sector of the population.

“In the pretend world where your family doctor would actually respond to a text, the labor-cost would be 11,000x higher than the cost to query chatGPT” stated a futurist

Could the impact be more meaningful in less-well-developed healthcare systems?

Or in situations that aren’t chronic.

Who bears responsibility when things go south?

Is the sample size of the study even significant enough to make such strong claims?

Thin line. And I don’t know. Yet.

Would you ask for medical advise from artificial intelligence chatbot assistant?
