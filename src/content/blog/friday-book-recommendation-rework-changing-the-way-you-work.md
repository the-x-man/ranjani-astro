“Planning is Guessing  
  
Unless you are a fortune teller, long-term business planning is a fantasy.  
  
There are too many factors that are out of your hands – market conditions, competitors, customers, economy etc.  
  
Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can’t actually control. At best, it is guess work.  
  
It tells us “This is where we are going because well, that’s where we said we are going”. Plans are inconsistent with improvisation.  
  
It doesn’t mean you should not think about the future – just not obsess over it. Plans more than a few pages long just wind up as fossils.  
  
Decide what you are going to do this week – not over years”  
  
This is one of topics addressed in this book that is filled with no-jargons-just-simple-rules-for-success.  
  
I am glad I picked up this relatively-unknown non-nonsense book about changing the way one works. Thanks to [Ankur Warikoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABOlvUB-6uQpj5VtIz3pACOBVaAzOdTRBA)‘s recommendation.  
  
And that is my Friday Book recommendation for the week.
