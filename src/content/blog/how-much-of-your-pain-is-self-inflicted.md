How much of your pain is self inflicted?

I struggle with public speaking.

There are too many thoughts vying for attention in my head that I want to share. It took me a week’s practice to get my TEDx talk right – whilst it took my husband a few hours.

Failing terrifies me. With sleepless nights – failing at something at work, missing my morning routine, being a bad mom, not being productive, missing my goals, messing up my health routine…..

Chatting with my mentor made me realise how much of this is self-inflicted.

That stems from wanting to never fail, to be the shiny example and wanting to please everyone.

And that is why this quote by [Steven Bartlett](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is on the money

“Successful people have mental health issues, bad habits, gaps in their knowledge moments of self doubt, procrastination issues, imperfect routines

Insecurities and imposter syndrome too.

But they also know that all of these things are perfectly normal. 

That is the difference”

Steven Bartlett

Have you paused to think about how much of your mental pain is self inflicted?
