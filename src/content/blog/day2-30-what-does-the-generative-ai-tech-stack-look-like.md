**#Day2**/30 **#30daysofGenerativeAI**

What does the tech stack look like and where will value accrue?

3 points.

**#1What** is exciting vs valuable: Today most of the posts on our feed talks about the models and the apps – ie. the customer facing layer.

Why? because it is exciting right now. But that is the most undifferentiated part of it – and potentially not the one where most value would accrue.

But like most things, understanding the tech stack helps us understand why companies like [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) are looking at this from a end to end strategic perspective.

**#2The** end to end tech stack

I quite love this a16z article that shares this view – “The stack can be divided into three layers:

**Applications** that integrate generative AI models into a user-facing product, either running their own model pipelines (“end-to-end apps”) or relying on a third-party API

**Models** that power AI products, made available either as proprietary APIs or as open-source checkpoints (which, in turn, require a hosting solution)

**Infrastructure** vendors (i.e. cloud platforms and hardware manufacturers) that run training and inference workloads for generative AI models”

**#3Where** is the current value?

**As the article states, ‘infrastructure vendors** are likely the biggest winners in this market so far, capturing the majority of dollars flowing through the stack. 

**Application companies** are growing top-line revenues very quickly but often struggle with retention, product differentiation, and gross margins.

And most **model providers**, though responsible for the very existence of this market, haven’t yet achieved large commercial scale”

**As one might imagine, the differentiation and retention is more likely where one has depth.**

**Does them imply more of a verticalized market thereby giving a structural advantage to incumbents?**

**But both strategies – vertical and horizontal market expansions come with its own pros/cons – example, agility vs differentiation.**

**It sometimes feels like with Generative AI, the tech sector behaves like a kid in a candy shop**

Or in my case, a librarian with endless supply of books and time.

Stay tuned to follow along the **#30daysofGenerativeAI** to understand not just the tech but the strategic outlook to the GenerativeAI market.
