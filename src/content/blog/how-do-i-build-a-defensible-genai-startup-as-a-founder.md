How do I build a a defensible GenAI startup as a founder?

Every tech startup I mentor has different problems.

Some on GTM, others on product roadmap and most on getting pilot customers.

Here are 5 reasons how successful startups operate differently

1Ô∏è‚É£ Are you a hammer in search of a nail?

8 out of 10 folks I speak to have solutions that look like wrappers to existing LLMs ‚Äì wanting to jump onto the AI bandwagon or pivoting from Web3.

2Ô∏è‚É£ In times of change, focus on what remains the same ‚Äì the fundamentals : The best CEOs and founders I have spoken to focus not on the hype but on foundations ‚Äì what is the problem the customers ‚Äúdesperately want to solve for‚Äù

An Healthcare AI CEO recently shared the life-changing experience of how one of their patients learnt about an anomaly that would have resulted in a 90% heart blockage because of the capabilities their AI tools allow them to capture their historical health trends that were earlier missed by their physicians

3Ô∏è‚É£ Problem first, Tech second :

Not all of the solutions need Generative AI ‚Äì I would even argue that less than 10% of the capabilities really need to be generative. But yes, it has brought in new focus on even traditional discriminative AI.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Obsessive about solving for customers JTBD

I love the jobs to be done framework. Like the popular adage goes, do you need a 9 inch nail or a 9 inch hole?

Founders who obsess about JTBD ‚Äì how can I help B2B customers understand the plant meat market with a curated GPT generated research saving weeks of consulting expense/time vs a I am building a ‚Äòfaster photo editor‚Äô

5Ô∏è‚É£ Governance and Integrity ‚Äì Are you playing the long game.

Integrity and customer value tend to go together. In this new world where responsible AI is still getting defined, the ones I tend to trust are the ones who do the right thing ‚Äì even when no one is watching.

Or governing.

**#ScalewithGenerativeAI** is a **#WeeklySeries** I am running on mentoring **#TechStartups** and **#SmallBusinesses** to leverage the power of AI to scale.

If you run a small business or a startup and looking to chat, I have opened up some weekend slots here : https://topmate.io/ranjaniandvignesh/342974

Especially if you have a women co-founder üôÇ
