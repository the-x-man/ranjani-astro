“Stop comparing your inside view with someone else’ outside”

I was listening to Omer Khan’s SaaS podcast featuring ThoughtExchange’s CEO, Dave Macleod.

Dave had once stopped reading Tech Crunch. Why?

To avoid seeing fabulous stories of IPO’s and Funding rounds when his company was still trying to get a grapple on their customer segment.

You never know why the company is raising rounds or what their health is. All that we see is a success from an external lens.’

He called out how we tend to compare all the knowledge of our environment (inside view) with what we think is a success as viewed from outside…

It was reminded me of how we do that each day of our lives. Compare notes between where and what we are, with flashy pictures from social media feeds.

I’d think it’s quite human a trait – not something one can completely do away with.

Albeit, something we can be conscious about this new year.
