A large majority of profiles that apply do not get shortlisted. Here are 5 tips on that could differentiate you

**#1**. If you do not know the hiring manager/person who can refer you – please don’t bombard strangers with ‘Hi’ messages on Linkedin. Do your homework upfront. Research about the company and roles they offer. Check out their careers page to identify open roles.

**#2**. I am yet to hear of one person who has actually got a role by typing ‘I am interested’ in comments. Invest your energy where it matters.

**#3**. Evaluate your why – why do you want a career in this space? What are your key skills – are you great at visualization, storytelling or building pipelines?

**#4**. Alignment to Role – Do your skillsets align with what is being offered? What are the gaps and are you working towards them? Again, do not aim for a 100% match.

**#5**. Do you have a portfolio of work that can showcase how you can add tangible value to the requisite role?

Now you can reach out to people within the organizations requesting for a referral. Share a summary of what role you are keen to apply, why and how you think you can add value upfront.

Being enterprising and focused alone differentiates you from the other 80% who aren’t.

Any other tips that has helped you?
