“The opportunity that lies ahead of us in Generative AI is to find diverse and deep use cases and build them”

How do you build defensible businesses with **#GenerativeAI**

I was listening to [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s talk at [Stanford University](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) on ‘The Opportunities in AI’

He made a highly relevant observation – one I see in a lot of startups I talk to that sounds like a hammer in search of a nail.

He shared the use case of Lensa – an app that allowed one to take picture of self and render as astronaut/scientist etc

After a spike in revenue, it dropped rapidly flatlining post the passing fad.

Why?

It was a good idea but it was thin software layer over a powerful API – “a useful product but not a defensible business or created long term business value”

The key thus, he calls out, to build sustainable businesses is to build, “Really deep and really hard applications that hopefully can create long term value”

And thus states that true work that lies ahead of us is to ‘finding diverse use-cases and to build them’

Are you looking at Problem first – Tech second?
