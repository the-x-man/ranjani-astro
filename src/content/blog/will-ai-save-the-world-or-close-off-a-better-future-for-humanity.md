Will AI save the world or close off a better future for humanity?

When I was in 7th or 8th we moved to a new neighbourhood that was next to one of the poshest locations in the city.

As I gazed out at the manicured lawns and huge bungalows, I asked Appa – “They have such an unfair advantage, Appa. How can I even compete against them as the salaried class”?

Appa smiled his always composed smile and said something I oft recollect.

‘Don’t compete on what is different – compete on what is the same : knowledge and time’

We live in an unfair world – there will always be folks with an advantage.

Whilst that isn’t something you can control – one thing I hope to leave my daughter with is the ability to use knowledge and awareness to one’s advantage.

Knowledge is the ultimate leveller

“The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function”

As you get bombarded by the evolving future of AI, seek to learn both sides of the argument

And then use your discretion with the information you have at that time.

Here are two extremely opposing views on the future of AI

Highly recommend you read both. Deeply.

And then think about what factors influenced each of the authors.

“Learn how to learn

from those you disagree with

or even offend you. See if you can find

the truth in what they believe.” – Kevin Kelly
