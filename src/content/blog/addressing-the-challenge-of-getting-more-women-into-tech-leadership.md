Why do so many girls top their classes at school and college and yet so few remain in the workforce a decade later?

What results in women dropping out of the workforce before they reach management positions – especially in Tech/STEM?

A McKinsey report shared a concept called the “broken rung”

“Yet even as more women reach senior management, too many are still getting stuck in entry-level jobs—”the broken rung” phenomenon.

Top-level female execs may be cracking the glass ceiling, but overall women are less likely to be promoted to or hired for leadership roles. With 72 women promoted to management for every 100 men, and men holding 62 percent of manager-level jobs…”

The WEF Global Gender Gap report 2020 states that the share of Women in Data and AI roles is at 32%.

A figure that likely drops further when you look at leadership in tech.

There is no single reason why this happens.

I am privileged to be part of organisations that considers diversity as not just the right thing to do but one that heralds us into a better future even from a business perspective.

I have heard so many views (and strong opinions) shared around this.

Change starts with our perspectives at home and at schools – in how we raise kids, roles we attribute to each family member and how we provide them opportunities and a solid support system.

All that I ask for are equal (not more) opportunities (and support) – Irrespective of who you are.

For everyone deserves a chance.

Nothing more. Nothing less.

What initiatives do you think can help increase girls’ participation in STEM?
