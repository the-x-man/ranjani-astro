How do orgs make money from Generative AI?

While Google went the path taking on ChatGPT with Bard, Amazon has focused on enabling others to build generative AI applications/integrations to their product suite.

And this is why that could be a smart move.

🔥 💬 “I think there will be a small handful of fundamental large models out there that other people build on.

But right now what happens is a company makes a large language model (API enabled to build on top of it), and I think there will be a middle layer that becomes really important where… I’m skeptical of all of the startups that are trying to train their own models.

I don’t think that’s going to keep going. But what I think will happen is there’ll be a whole new set of startups that take an existing very large model of the future and tune it, which is not just fine tuning, all of the things you can do.

I think there’ll be a lot of access provided to create the model for medicine or using a computer or a friend or whatever.

And then those companies will create a lot of enduring value because they will have a special version of it.

They won’t have to have created the base model, but they will have created something they can use just for themselves or share with others that has this unique data flywheel going that improves over time and all of that.

So I think there will be a lot of value created in that middle layer. ” 💬 🔥 – Sam Altman

While the likes of Open AI have verticalized tech stack – from infra to compute, there is bound to be a market for customised sector specific focus, say healthcare.

While these smaller players lack the deep pockets for the infra that Open AI has, what they still can do is to build and finetune on the existing base models.

And offerings such as Amazon Bedrock could help there

“Bedrock makes several foundational models from Amazon and other companies available via API.

What makes it compelling is that it makes it really easy to point to some AWS S3 data, and fine-tune the models for your specific task at hand. This is perfect for companies looking to easily integrate generative in their products”

Here is a TL DR of Amazon’s capabilities

👉 Bedrock – enabling developers to leverage existing base models

👉 Amazon EC2 Trn1n and Inf2 – Train models cheaper and faster ie reduce cost of generative AI

👉 Amazon CodeWhisperer – The Github co-pilot equivalent : help developers code with generative AI

Such an absolutely exciting (and terrifying) space to watch unfold 🙂
