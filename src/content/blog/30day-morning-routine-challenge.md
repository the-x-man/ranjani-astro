Sleep is the first thing I have compromised on when pushed for time.

Like most folks.

It helped that I can survive with very little of it.

But starting tomorrow, I am getting back to my routine of journalling, meditation, workout and tracking my 7 hours of sleep

So here is to my public **#30DayChallenge** to stick to my morning routine

Seems like a good time to revisit this book review episode from earlier.

Why We Sleep? 3 things you should absolutely know about how sleep impacts your life

**#1** The impact of sleep neglect on health

**#2** What happens when we sleep

**#3** The effect of sleep deprivation on emotional health and weight gain

Why, though it seems time-wasting/unproductive, we still need to get a good nightâ€™s sleep to get a long list of physiological, biological, psychological benefits.

I realize now that I sounded like a news-caster and the conveyer of bad news ðŸ™‚

Wellâ€¦ one grows, one learns!
