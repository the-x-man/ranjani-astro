Books of 2022

Here are my books from the first half of 2022 and 5 reflections on reading

**#1** This year I decided not to force myself to read books towards â€˜being betterâ€™ and read â€˜to enjoyâ€™ â€“ yet I gravitated towards ones I feel I derive most â€˜valueâ€™ from.

**#2** Experimentation â€“ I switched from sticking to thrillers in fiction to romance but didnâ€™t enjoy it as much as I thought I would â€“ yet, I loved the experience.

**#3** Nonetheless, thanks to the loose boundaries, I ended up reading a lot more Crichton and Agatha Christie than I wanted to â€“ classics that I quite enjoyed

**#4** I skimmed through some of them (Breath) whilst I re-read others (SuperThinking). Not all books seem to deserve the same mental faculties

**#5** Time boxing for books aligned to my energy levels â€“ To optimize my reading, I do Audio books for heavy non-fiction which I do when multi tasking in the mornings, lighter non-fiction in Kindle at night and mysteries and thrillers as a paper back on weekends

And finally, it doesnâ€™t matter if you read 30 or 3.

What does is you do.

There are too many books and too little time ðŸ™‚

Happy Reading!
