I think the first time I met [Guru Bhat](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) was at a conference where he spoke about the Art of Storytelling.

I was absolutely blown away by his depth and charisma as a leader, and the intense self awareness and knowledge, he exudes

Since then, I have followed everything he has written on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) – from leadership to career principles

I have come out of every conversation with him, feeling overwhelmed by how little I know, to being inspired by wanting to be like him.

Guru is currently the VP of Customer Success Platforms for PayPal and responsible for Product Management and Engineering for all technology delivering customer success. 

He is also the General Manager of PayPal’s India Centers (5000+ employees) in Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad.

Beyond all that, he is an exceptional leader.

So when I decided to do **#Leadertalks** as part of PIVOT – to Support and Connect Women in Product and AI to Scale into Leadership, I couldn’t think of a better leader to start with, than Guru Bhat

I am super excited to host [Guru Bhat](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) in Episode 2 of **#LeaderTalks** as part of PIVOT this Saturday (20 Aug) between 11 AM – 12 PM, IST on Linkedin LIVE.

We talk about how we can support women to scale into leadership as an ally

And his advice for women to be more intentional in their careers.
