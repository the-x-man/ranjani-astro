Do you know this thing when you are scrolling through mails and intend to get back to some of them.

And then you never do.

Or you do and you need to read again to understand the context.

One of the hacks that works with this is the 2 minute rule.

It is simple – “If it takes less than two minutes, then do it now.”

It means that if you are processing something and it take you less than 2 minutes to take action. Do it right then

People may misinterpret this to mean, take 2 mins to answer the emails whenever they pop up.

No. That will result in context switching

Do this instead.

**#1** Remove notifications if you haven’t already.

**#2** Allocate pomodoros (25 min slots) across the day when you check emails

**#3** If it takes 2 mins or less, do it when you are processing the information

Let me know how this works out.
