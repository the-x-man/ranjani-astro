“You are so ‘lucky’ to have such a helpful spouse. You should teach him how to change napkins too”, piped in a relative, 2 weeks after I had my kid.

“I don’t think the childbirth included a manual that taught me how to change one and missed my husband’, I retorted. Much to my mom’s chagrin.

Yes, stats in this video is glaring, ‘71% of women in India sleep less than their husbands due to household chores.’.

But it isn’t just the physical tasks that drain working women.

Its honestly is the mental load.

Nonetheless, a large portion of the mental load – from planning play dates to organizing school work – in childcare, tends to fall on the mother.

The sheer number of things that are top of mind in terms of things to get done – at work, home, groceries, finances, passions, and for the kid is overwhelming at times.

So if you are a woman who looks at her career, her motherhood, her goals, and her role in the household as equally important identities, then it is a constant battle.

I wouldn’t be surprised if more women give up their passions. Not just their careers, in this pandemic.

The mental load driven by generations of social conditioning carried by women in running a household is tremendous. I can’t even understate how much more this has impacted us during the pandemic

The most precious commodity of it most working women is probably – TIME.

And hopefully, this gets better with time too 🙂
