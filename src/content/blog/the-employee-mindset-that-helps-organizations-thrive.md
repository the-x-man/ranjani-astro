What employee ‘mindset’ can help organizations and individuals thrive?

Success in the Knowledge economy vs in the Industrial era requires organizations need to be nimble and react quickly when necessary.

Permanent flexibility requires a culture of constant learning.

HBR terms them as ‘Gig Mindsetters’ – “a bold new breed of full-time, salaried employees who think and act like freelancers — self-manage, take spontaneous initiative, focus on skills more than roles, feel free to shortcut processes, and don’t hesitate to question the status quo”

These are folks who share what they learn with others, take ownership of their own personal growth, and feel confident in their ability to influence people.

The article discusses two companies that cultivated gig mindset learning cultures and how they did this. Link – [HBR](https://hbr.org/2022/01/how-workers-with-a-gig-mindset-can-help-your-company-thrive)
