[Morgan Housel](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) asks brilliant questions.

In his blog, he recently asked 6 questions.

Ones that make you ponder over them. And learn something about yourself.

The one that caught my fancy the most is – “What have you changed your mind about in the last decade?”

The writer Derek Thomson, to whom the question was asked, make the astute observation that as education changes the way middle class thinks about the society, the cultural wars used my politicians may no longer work.

For me, there are so many things. Sometimes, I feel like a different person now that I was a decade ago.

I have been a Type A personality, wanting to do it all and positively impact the world. If there is one thing that I have learnt over the last decade, it is this –

“Go slow to go fast”.

“What have you changed your mind about in the last decade?”
