“You’re trying to buy a sweater, and you go into a store and you find a sweater that fits you.

It looks good. It’s the right price. You buy it, you’re happy, you’re done. Right? It meets all of your criteria. You are a Satisficer.

If you are a Maximizer – you will see that sweater and kind of put it under another sweater, so nobody will buy it.

And just in case, go to the next store.

And keep looking, because maybe they’ll find something a little bit cheaper or a little bit more attractive or, you know, whatever it is, right?

And they keep looking, and then maybe they find it. Maybe they don’t.

But if they do find it, they tend not to be as happy with that purchase as if they had just bought the original sweater.

And if they don’t find it, then they regret that they didn’t get the original one.

And you see this in relationships and with jobs.

It’s with everything.

The satisficer is one who wants what she has, and the maximizer is the one who is always chasing, trying to have what he wants.

Have you stopped to think?

Are you a satisficer, or are you a maximizer?”

Probably because I have been contemplating about changes recently. Or maybe because it touches upon what really matters to us

Beautiful podcast. Give it a listen.

And ask yourself – if you are a satisficer or a maximizer?
