> ‘Diagonelly” says Harry Potter, instead of Diagon Alley – teleporting himself into a different place in the book, Chamber of Secrets.

If you don’t fancy Floo Powder one could use Portkeys and Vanishing Cabinets for magically transporting self.

What if, in reality, you could get from A to B, without moving your body.

With tech that works like magic.

An Avatar \[Sanskrit for “incarnation of a deity in human or animal form to counteract some particular evil in the world”\] can be one of two forms –

A digital avatar – as you move in the real world, your avatar moves in the digital.

Robots are the second form of avatar – a humanoid robot.

“To be able to connect with loved ones you aren’t able to see often

Doctors and teachers are able to use their expertise anywhere in the world

Go into space or a disaster relief zone without risking human life

Sense the breeze, smell and interact with the remote environment

Scoop sand in the tropics and feel grains running through your fingers.”

Can this become ‘black mirrorish’ if we aren’t careful? Maybe.

As with any tech – this too is amplified by our intentions and actions of us.

Humans.

ANA has funded a $10M xPRize to speed up development of the robotic avatars
