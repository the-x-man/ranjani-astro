I am doing a **#30daysofWeb3** challenge in April.

It is still early in the journey

And the best thing you can do is to get educated.

So here are 5 bullets on Day 1 – Why Web 3.0, Ownership and Tokens

**#1** **Why Web 3.0** : “Crypto has one feature that has never existed before – trust. – Ben Horowitz”

Where are you today relying on trust? On banks to get paid or lawyers to draw up contracts.

**#2** **How will the world be different with Web 3.0 :** Trust implies ownership. “By reducing the middleman tax, people can finally own the upside from their work. Web3 matters because we’re building an internet owned by people instead of middlemen.”

**#3 What does the evolution of web look like?**

Web1: Read | Where we navigated static pages built on http protocols

Web2: Read, write | Most of what today looks like. We create and consume content through web giant platforms sitting in the middle. Based on client-server architecture.

Web3: Read, write, own | Create, consume and own work through tokens. Built on P2P computer networks sans middlemen

**#4 What is a Token?** 

Think of it as a record of ownership of an asset that lives on a blockchain

**#5 What are Fungible or Non-Fungible Tokens?**

Fungible tokens are interchangeable records – think USD or Rupee

Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique crypto tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. Ex – Art.

Think of it as a Non-interchangeable unit of data. It is an Ethereum based asset

Tomorrow we will look at understanding why Web 3.0 matters for users and blockchain – which is foundational to Web 3.0
