What is the Future of Generative AI Products?

Products and AI – are two of my absolutely favourite areas.

So what forms would Generative AI products take?

Generative AI products take a number of different forms says a a16z article – from desktop apps, mobile apps, Figma/Photoshop plugins, Chrome extensions, even Discord bots.

There are two ways to think about where the products will come from :

☝ Stand alone companies – (Mid journey?)

✌ Super Charged AI Products through incumbents integrating it into their product lines ( Think about what [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is already doing with AI powered Bing through Search and product discovery.

Or what [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) could do through personalising curated feeds)

Why? It is easy to “integrate AI products where users already work, since the UI is generally just a text box”

Let think through the [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) example.

Why is AI enabled customisation such a brilliant use case –

In a [WIRED](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) video, Dartmouth college professor Chandrasekhar Ramanathan has been tasked to explain the concept of quantum sensing to 5 different people; a child, a teen, a college student, a grad student, and an expert.

Think about doing that with the AI – ‘if you’re explaining why it rains, you’ll use different language for an eight-year-old than for a high school student’

Coming back to an analogy of personalisation on a product I use daily – [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

I was wondering what a user persona story would an AI enabled personalised feed look like –

‘As an user, based on my unique profile \[Engagement + Experience + Interests…\], the feed would explain (curate) content on the same topics but with complexity as relevant to my profile”

That could imply the difference between explaining “habit forming” as a concept by Robin Sharma’s 5 AM club vs Nir Eyal’s Indistractable.

For the record, I prefer the latter.

While this is such an early (and evolving) space – I am hugely excited about how “this technology will impact how we work, learn, create, and play”
