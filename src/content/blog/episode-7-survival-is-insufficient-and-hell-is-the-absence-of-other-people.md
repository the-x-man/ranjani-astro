Genre – Dystopian Fiction

Book 9/52

Book – [Station 11, Emily St John Mandel](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B00JQ9FYAM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?%5Fencoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

“Survival is insufficient and Hell is the absence of other people”

The book, a fiction at that, is quite topical to our times.

“Station 11”, is a dystopian novel that is set in the days of civilization’s collapse after a pandemic has devastated the world.

It is hauntingly beautiful and in conclusion you are reminded that humanity always chooses hope over annihilation.

It is what makes us human.

Stay safe. Stay put.
