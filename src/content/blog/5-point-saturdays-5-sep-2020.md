Hi All!

Here is your weekly dose of “5 Point Saturdays,” interesting tidbits from what I have been Reading: Latest reviews, Books, Weekly challenges, Learning Hacks, and More!

#### Point 2 – The Coffee Bean Story about resilience. 

I heard this during my morning's meditation session  
 and it stayed with me for long after.  
_There is a young lady and she is having many kinds_ 
 _of challenges in her life. She comes to her mother to_ 
_complain about it. Her mother just smiles and leads_ 
_her to the kitchen. She puts three pots of water and_ 
_starts boiling them and her daughter is wondering_ 
_what’s going on. In one she puts carrots, in another_ 
_she adds eggs and in the third she adds coffee_ 
 _beans._ 
_And as the water comes to a boil, she removes each_ 
 _of those three vessels and as it cools down she asks_ 
 _her daughter to examine the three vessels._ 
_The daughter finds that the carrots have become_ 
_very soft, the eggs have become quite hard and_ 
_the water with the coffee has gotten colored._ 
_She turns and asks her mother, ‘ What is this._ 
_What are you trying to teach me?’_
_The mother smiles and says, ‘the carrots went in..._

#### Point 3 – Quote that I bookmarked

“If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better.”

#### Point 4 – Latest video review on the block!

#### Point 5 – What I am listening to

My dad’s parents were from a teensy town near Palakkad.

Raised in Bangalore, I never really learnt to speak fluent Malayalam, but I have lovely memories of watching Malayalam movies with him on weekends…

Memories that I still cherish.

I recently heard this brilliant earworm of a song featuring the lush landscapes of Kerala and can’t seem to stop listening to it. Give it a listen and let me know how you like it!
