What do you think of this AI translated demo of Lex Friedman and Mark Z speaking in Hindi

The Twitter user @therealprady built a beta using GPT-4 + prompt engineering for translation

What I do like about it is the preservation of the Original Speakersâ€™ voice and tonality â€“ something that most translations miss

What I do miss, as someone who understands the language, is that it doesnâ€™t in the least represent how a native speaker would converse

More colloquial versions might be what the future would look like (I hope)

[Pavan Reddy](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) â€“ Reminded me of the work your startup is doing in this space. DM me if you have a beta that is ready to be tried out by end customers ðŸ™‚

\[11labs for voice training + text-to-speech in other languages while preserving the OG speakers voice

wav2lip-2 API to lipsync the video to the translated audio in HD \[sota model + API in beta by @synchronicitylabs\]
