“Containment of Technology is not possible”

What is the “Containment problem – how do we keep a grip on the most valuable technologies invented as they get cheaper and spread faster?”

And why are they so hard to contain?

General purpose technologies such as AI and Synthetic Biology share 4 key features that explain why this isn’t Business as Usual, argues, Mustafa Suleyman

In his new book, ‘The Coming Wave : Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century’s Greatest Dilemma”

**#1** They are inherently general and therefore omni-use.

Example – Think of ways in which AI is and can get leveraged across sectors and use cases

**#2** They hyper-evolve

**#3** They have asymmetric impact

**#4** And in some respect, they are increasingly autonomous

The creation of this tech is driven by powerful incentives, geopolitical competition, massive rewards and open distributed culture of research.

The coming decade, he speculates will make us the most productive in history – a ‘step change in capability – introducing both risks and innovation at an awesome scale’

A lot of the rest of the book is on how Suleyman speculates regarding HOW to contain these technologies

Sometimes it feels like Alice in Wonderland and all I can say is, It gets ‘curiouser and curiouser’ 🙂
