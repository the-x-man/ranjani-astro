You could be a people manager or an individual contributor but this holds true nonetheless.

When setting goals for self or the team – Set 2 types of goals

80-20 goals and 50-50 goals

What does that mean?

– A 80-20 goal is one that is 80% likely to get done. It allows realistic completion and provides positive feedback from outcomes achieved

– A 50 – 50 goal is one that is 50% likely to get done. This is a bit of a stretch goal which challenge self/others to stretch the edge of their potentials

What are the types of goals you are seen the most success with?
