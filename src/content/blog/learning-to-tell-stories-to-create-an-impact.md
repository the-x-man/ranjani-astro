Around 5 weeks ago, I started on this journey to learn to tell better stories.

From one of the best design and innovation organizations – IDEO

Across these weeks, we have had the opportunity to work with fabulous coaches and a cohort of highly creative people from around the world

Identifying the story that I want to tell, to change the world  
– one sticky note at a time.

From developing a blueprint into storytelling prototypes and finally bringing the story to life

I realized how difficult it is to pare down the numbers and make it personal and emotional.

How it takes multiple iterations to simplify – and then some more.

To finally come up with a narrative \[which is for another post\]

It still is a journey – and there are iterations to go.

But I would definitely approach communicating for impact differently.

Especially in storytelling with numbers.
