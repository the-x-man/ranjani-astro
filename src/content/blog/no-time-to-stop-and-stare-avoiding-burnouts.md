Do you know that feeling of Guilt combined with Fear?

The kind that envelops you when you know you are wasting time glued to your screen instead of studying for an impending exam.

That probably is normal \[and requisite\] if there is a exam to write the next day.

I felt that almost on a regular basis when my mind identified me being involved in activities I classified as ‘not productive’.

While it may seem like being productive and constantly learning is a good thing – humans need down-time.

Time doing nothing.

I haven’t felt the need for the downtime as much as I did over this last year.

I realized I was fatigued by the end of the day – something I never really felt earlier. I was trying to do too many things.

I stopped to reassess my priorities and non-negotiables – sleep, meditation or working out.

Here is a reminder to all to learn to recognize stress, being more mindful and rather than adding initiatives – to pick ones that really matter.

And most importantly, have time slotted in your calendars to do nothing.

Reminded me of this poem from 4th grade

Leisure – WH. Davies
