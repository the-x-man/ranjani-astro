5 questions to evaluate the culture of an org during your interview process.

While we evaluate offers based on factors from compensation to titles, here are some red flags to look out for and points to assess before you take the call!

1️⃣ Are the recruiters supporting you through the hiring process : Great orgs have recruiters who play more of a partner role through your interviewing process. They want you to succeed and thus support you with context and content required to prepare you for each round – not just schedule them

2️⃣ How do your interviewers address your questions and concerns – Are they being transparent about what works or isn’t. Are they being very prescriptive or do you have the ability to drive changes. Are you an executor or a strategizer – or what combination of both

3️⃣ Do they live the company values : Can they highlight instances where the values aren’t just bullets on the wall.

4️⃣ How inclusive is the culture in action?

I once interviewed with an org where I didn’t meet a single diverse leader across the 7 rounds – a huge red flag personally.

5️⃣ How close is the maturity of the environment to what you seek : Many a time, I hear job seekers talk a lot about the the org but ask very little to assess the maturity of the team they are joining. A nascent org has very different problems and focus vs a mature one. And that has a huge impact on where, how and with whom you will work.

What else would you add to this list?
