You can be a woman, be ambitious about your career and be unapologetic about it!

Who do so many girls top their classes at school and college and yet so few remain in the workforce a decade later.

What results in women dropping out of the workforce before they reach management positions?

A McKinsey report called it the “broken rung”

“Yet even as more women reach senior management, too many are still getting stuck in entry-level jobs—”the broken rung” phenomenon.

Top-level female execs may be cracking the glass ceiling, but overall women are less likely to be promoted to or hired for leadership roles. With 72 women promoted to management for every 100 men, and men holding 62 percent of manager-level jobs, women simply can’t catch up”

There is no single reason why this happens.

I am privileged to be part of an organisation that considers diversity as not just the right thing to do but one that heralds us into a better future with diverse perspectives.

I have benefited tremendously from mentors and continue to do so. Its my personal goal hence to pay it forth and help more women overcome the ‘broken rung’.

This month thus, I signed up pro-bono to mentor women looking at getting into leadership positions in tech and entrepreneurship on Women’ Global Mentoring program in STEM and Kerala’s Startup Mission.

If you are a woman in tech looking to move into management positions and struggling with it, share you inputs on what is holding you back.

Let’s work not just in getting women back to work. But also in leadership roles.
