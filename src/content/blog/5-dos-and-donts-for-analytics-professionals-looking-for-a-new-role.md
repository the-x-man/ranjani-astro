5 Do’s and Don’ts for data scientists/analytics professionals looking for a new role

1. If you do not know the hiring manager/person who can refer you – please don’t bombard people with ‘Hi’ messages on Linkedin.
2. Do your homework upfront. Research about the company and roles they offer. Check out their careers page to identify open roles.
3. Evaluate your why – why do you want a career in this space? What are your key skills – are you great at visualization, storytelling or building pipelines?
4. Alignment to Role – Do your skillsets align with what is being offered? Again, do not aim for a 100% match.
5. Do you have a portfolio of work that can showcase how you can add tangible value to the requisite role?

Now you can reach out to people within the organizations requesting for a referral.

Share a summary of what role you are keen to apply, why and how you think you can add value upfront.

Being enterprising and focused alone differentiates you from the other 80% who aren’t.

Any other tips?
