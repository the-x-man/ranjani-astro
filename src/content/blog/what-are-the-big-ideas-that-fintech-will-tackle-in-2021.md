What are 4 Big Ideas that Fintech Will Tackle in 2021

The a16z fintech team weighs in – Read more about the top trends and what is driving them

**#1** Disintermediating the banking system

\> Banks usually serve as intermediaries between the consumer and the government.

\> Fintech, the article states, allows governments to remove intermediate bureaucracy and make monetary services available directly to the citizens

\> With >5B of folks today having mobile internet connectivity, “every consumer eventually will access their savings, loans, and investments via a mobile app”

**#2** Adding insurance to the financial services

\> Every company will be a fintech company” – Consumer and B2B companies have seen the opportunity to add fintech (payments, lending..) to drive revenue. Now, can companies add services such as insurance to that?

\> Historically asset and insurance purchase have been de-coupled (car, insurance)

\> Can we embed insurance at the point of purchase?

**#3** Emergence of ‘Social+’ fintech products

\> Start-up success is attributed to two things – product and distribution insight ( what the core USP offers and how well it is distributed)

\> New fintech products focus on leveraging ‘network effects’ – more utility when used with others – thereby driving incentive to drive distribution

\> “Multiplayer products have built-in growth levers, they make activity around money — investing, financial planning, even saving — more engaging and fun!”

**#4** Emerging new asset classes

\> Imagine a small investor owning a classic painting? Is that even an investment you have considered? What if it is made available through a ‘fractionalized ownership’ model?

What other trends have you noticed in the Fintech space post COVID?
