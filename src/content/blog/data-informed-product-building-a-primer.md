What is the most useful article you have ever read?

[Sequoia Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) did a 39 part series spread out over a couple of years around ‘Data Informed Product Building’

It covers almost everything one can think of around how products evolve, defining product health, frameworks for success to pitfalls in diagnosing health and setting metrics.

It deep-dives into how consumer products such as Facebook drive engagement, how algorithms are designed to what it takes to building a sustainable product.

It finally rounds it off with what it takes to be a data scientist and how one can set and scale data organisations and most importantly make data science work.

The world constantly changes around us. Sometimes, it feels like there is so much to do and learn.

In times of overwhelm, focus on the fundamentals.

And this series does a brilliant job of it. Took me almost a month to get through it.

Highly recommend – whether you are a startup, a leader or an employee who is looking at making a difference.
