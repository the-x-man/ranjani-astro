Why does Sam Altman want to now venture into AI hardware?

The article reports that ‘renowned iPhone designer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have been in talks about collaborating on a new consumer AI hardware device – including what “new hardware for the AI age could look like.

In one of the keynotes, Nadella talks about a key lever influencing the current AI proliference – Natural Language Interface.

In one of the Gen AI panel discussions I was on, a panelists called out “Part of the reason for the AI boom today is putting an UI in front of an AI”

Could hardware play a similar role – especially for folks who aren’t in the knowledge work space?
