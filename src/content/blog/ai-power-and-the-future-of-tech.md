The Coming Wave – AI, Power and 21st century’s Greatest Dilemma

I am currently reading this book by Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Deepmind that talks about how the coming decade “will be defined by this wave of powerful, fast-proliferating new technologies.

Driven by overwhelming political and commercial incentives, these tools will help address our global challenges and create vast wealth – but also upheaval on a once unimaginable scale”

“As our fragile governments sleepwalk into disaster, we face an existential dilemma: unprecedented harms arising from unchecked openness on one side, the threat of overbearing surveillance on the other.

Can we forge a narrow path between catastrophe and dystopia?”

I truly believe that Technology, inherently isn’t good or bad

It depends on the views of the creator

So something I think about oft is whether we are creating a future we want out kids to live in

Whilst the best we can do right now is to be aware – both for ourselves and our kids, a visual I want to leave you with is this

How Tech drives GDP growth. Unquestionably

So whilst we may not have all the answers doesn’t mean one should stop seeking to ask questions

Stay Curious
