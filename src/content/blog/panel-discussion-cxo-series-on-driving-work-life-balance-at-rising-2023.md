Appa stood outside until I finished my day long interview at [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) – my first job.

When I rushed out with an offer that evening, dad took me first to a temple and then to celebrate with ice cream.

The room full of young women – fresh faced, eager about their careers ahead of them reminded me of the girl that day – so joyously looking forth to the world ahead of her.

Someone asked me about ‘How I’d define self worth?’ in the panel yesterday at [Analytics India Magazine](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s Rising’23 Women in Tech conference.

Interestingly, that has changed several times over time

From having financial independence, promotions, titles, charter and growth to being able to meaningful work and having control over my time and do things I love to engage in.

So like the Sunscreen song says, “Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t”

As always, an honour to stage stage with [Pooja Goyal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), [Jayashree Mitra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Vanitha D’Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#). And the lovely moderator [Vijayalakshmi Anandan](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)
