Did you catch the ‘Daring Greatly’ LinkedIn Live session [Prashant Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and I did on Financial Literacy for Women last Sat?

If there is one thing to take-away, it is his R2T2 framework

**#1** R2T2 stands for Risk – Returns; Time- Trade-off. The concept is simple but fundamental to how we view wealth

**#2** Align your expectations of Returns with the Risk. You cannot expect returns of 15%+ with the security of Fixed Deposits. If anyone promises that – stay away from it

**#3** Your financial investments are dependent on your goals. If your risk appetite doesn’t allow for it, it shouldn’t bother you that your neighbor invests in crypto

**#4** If A is your current wealth value and B is your corpus destination you need in 20 years to maintain the same lifestyle, think of the investment vehicles that are various options to get there. He also shared a nifty back-of the envelop calculation to identify the corpus you need

**#5** Play the long term game. Time- trade-off. If you can stay put for 20 years, there is very little chance of you losing money from the markets

Check out the recording in the link below.

Fill in the google forms link for a follow-up financial literacy workshop for women that Prashant Desai and I are planning to have on the topic .

It is free and will always be.

I am hoping this helps with my goal of positively impacting at least 100 women this year!
