Are people happier by changing their environments?

A new job, a different car, moving countries, maybe a more receptive spouse, a better behaved kid or investments that grow at 14%?

For the longest time I assumed so too.

Asked myself pointless questions – should I have done an MS instead of an MBA? Should we try living out of a different city? et all

It honestly doesn’t matter.

People who win the coveted lottery prize experience high levels of happiness at the time. … The influx of happiness can last about a year but will recede gradually to the normal sense of happiness and well-being

It is called hedonic adaptation. \[Adding the link to the paper in comments\]

Once you have your basic needs met, humans tends to return to their baseline happiness post the initial spike of positivity/negativity.

[Adam Grant](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) talks about this in his latest book, Think again – where he cites the example of a student trying to move colleges with the hope that a ‘different college might make her happier’.

I have been listening to the Daily Gita podcast by Neil Bhatt

He talks about how all experiences are impermanent \[ Chapter 2, verse 16\] – ‘I have sorrow, but I am not sorrowful’.

So whether you follow science or spirituality, be mindful of whether you are constantly chasing rainbows.

Have you noticed instances of hedonic treadmill?
