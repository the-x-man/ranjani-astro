100% Is Easier Than 98%

… it’s easier to hold to your principles 100% of the time than it is to hold to them 98% of the time.

Going the extra mile than the majority is what differentiates one in a normal distribution.

It is quite easy to get lost in the middle

– Be that mentee who is clear about what they seek to improve

– Be that leader who puts people first in any decision

– Be that interviewee who sends a thank you note to his/her interviewers for their feedback – even if they don’t get the role

– Be that person who does their homework regarding the role before asking for a referral

– Be that intern who spends time understanding not just his role but that of the team

– Be that team member who raises their hand and takes ownership to solve the problem that helps the entire team

Set your personal excellence and integrity boundaries

The boundary — your personal moral line — is powerful because you don’t cross it; if you have justified doing it once, there’s nothing to stop you from doing it again

“Decide what you stand for. And then stand for it all the time.”

— Clayton Christensen, Harvard Business Professor

Or as my dad used to oft say – “If you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything”
