If there is one critical skill to grow as a leader, what would that be?

Connecting the dots and Interpreting information

Large organizations are complex.

There is humongous amount of information and teams.

Instead of just seeing and looking out for what one expects, synthesizing information across all the inputs one is an essential skill.

Most of the times, we wait for things to happen. To be told.

And given a map.

Recognizing patterns, pushing through ambiguity and understanding implications across stakeholders is critical

For this, we need to start connecting the dots. Be inquisitive and seek information.

Think beyond what you are told. Solve problems for your organization

What do you see as essential leadership skills?
