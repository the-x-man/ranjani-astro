Why everyone needs a personal moat to accelerate their career?

One of my favourite newsletters is the Morning Brew

Alex Lieberman, the founder recently did a podcast of the topic of building a personal moat

What is a moat, you ask?

A business moat is a key competitive advantage that sets a company apart from its competitors. Think Apple’s switching costs or Louis Vuitton’s branding

Think of translating that to your careers.

How do you find a mix that creates a massive unlock in your career?

Here is a summary

1) Build social currency – Not the 30 under 30 temporary awards, network, reputation, and brand that is accumulated from demonstrating specific knowledge or skills for a long period of time

2) T shaped person – Going deep : “If you’re going to become an expert around something, truly do”. Build skills that cannot be easily outsourced or commoditised.

3) Build specific skills – He calls out 4 of them :

– Engineering and speaking the language of tech

– Content creation and audience building

– Critical thinking

– EQ

4) How do you choose knowledge areas : Choose ones that deeply interest you. And those that will be big in 5/10 years from now. I completely resonate with the ones he calls out – Web3 and crypto, fintech, health tech, the creator economy, and sustainable businesses.

All of this doesn’t need one to start a business. You could try becoming the indispensable employee.

How do you look at building personal moats?
