👀 How Nvidia may be inching towards the $1Tn club!

Sell shovels during a gold rush, they say

With the AI gold rush, NVIDIA just added $200 billion in market cap and they may be on their way to becoming the first $1 Trillion chip company

“As tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta rush to build AI capabilities similar to ChatGPT, they need pricey chips and as WSJ’s Dan Gallagher explains, that’s good for Nvidia”

Nvidia late on Wednesday announced a second-quarter revenue target more than 50% above Wall Street estimates with plans to boost supply to meet surging demand for its AI chips, which are used to power popular services including ChatGPT.

What a ride!

And what a time to be alive 🙂
