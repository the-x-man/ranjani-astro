Trust. Web 3.0\. Metaverse and the Future of Human Race

A Thread – Part 1

**#1** If you think about it deeply, co-operation is the basis of the rise of human civilization.

**#2** As nomadic hunter-gatherers, our trust to watch out for each other was primarily social. Over time, this translated into ‘institutional trust’. Think temple, churches, governments an finally co-operations – this is still our predominant model.

Collapses and peppered financial crises has questioned the gatekeepers of trust – can we do any better?

**#3** Can the new paradigm of trust be… programmable? Enabled by software and based on a fundamental entity beyond the authority of an institution..

One where all network users and operators are required to follow the same set of hardcoded rules, known as consensus protocols.

Can there be an open source of internet and trust?
