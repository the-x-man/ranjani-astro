Selling digital shirts, NFT’s and the emergence of virtual economy in metaverses

Ralph Lauren is now letting people buy digital clothing for their avatars within a virtual world in a new collaboration with Zepeto.

Zepeto is the South Korean social network and its 200 million users that interact in a virtual world. 

Ralph Lauren’s first line of digital products include 12 looks that cost between $.57 to $2.86 

Going a step further, they have also partnered to create a virtual version of the company’s flagship Madison Avenue store and a version of Central Park complete with accompanying coffee trucks.

“It’s also the largest metaverse in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a “hugely important market for us”, said their chief digital officer.

And a few months ago, I was wondering about how big of a market could exist for NFTs.

How do you see this accelerating? Is there a game for Indian players here?
