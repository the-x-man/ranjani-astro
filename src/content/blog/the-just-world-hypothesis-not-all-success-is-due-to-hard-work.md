People don’t always get what they deserve

We are brought up with a cognitive bias that assumes that actions have morally fair and fitting consequences.

That the noble actions will be rewarded and evil will be punished. This also impacts the way we interpret others’ actions.

The Just World Hypothesis postulates that

‘It can be challenging to acknowledge that a good portion of your success stems from luck”

I speak from a position of privilege when I talk about financial independence given I was born to parents who valued equality and education.

One where I could go back to work 3 months after my maternity leave because I had a solid support system.

I also am aware that I can be the minority in the room oft assumed to be there to take notes. That it isn’t always assumed that I understand tech until I call it out.

“Many people instead choose to believe that the world is completely fair, orderly, and predictable.”

This mental model is called the just world hypothesis – where people always get what they deserve, good or bad, because of their actions alone, with no accounting for luck or randomness.

As the book Superthinking calls out, being aware of this mental model would allow you to understand the world a teensy bit better 🙂

As [Morgan Housel](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) puts it, teach you kids that

**“Not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness.** 

**Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself”**
