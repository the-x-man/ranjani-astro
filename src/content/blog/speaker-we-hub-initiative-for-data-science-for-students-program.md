Spent the morning being part of something that is a huge passion –

speaking at [WE Hub, A Government of Telangana Initiative](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) at their ‘Data Science for students’ Program for – mentoring young girls in STEM.

WE Hub is India’s First State-led incubator to foster Women Entrepreneurs, Urban Entrepreneurship and Social/ Impact Entrepreneurship

The program was launched in the presence of the Hon’ble Minister for IT E C, Govt. of Telangana, in June 2021 

Through this program, WE Hub aims to reach 100 girl students across 5 states in India to actively think about solutions to real-world problems which can create an impact on the environment and society.

Love the state-led focus on trainer trainers and bringing in young girls in this space!

More power to all of you young women and for working towards an equal playing field!
