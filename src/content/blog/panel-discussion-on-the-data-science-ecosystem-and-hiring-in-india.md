It was fun being part of the [Kaggle Days Meetup Delhi NCR](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kdmdelhi/)  
panel discussion on the data science ecosystem and skills young professionals could develop  
  
Great chatting with fellow panelists [Shikha Agrawal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAEXBVkB2cJybfLqYVXW0wIJ-CWjL4WdZQg) and [Kamal Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADT-DIBWAOmsGH2vot%5FIvuXlpQMRs4G72s) along with the awesome moderator [Dr. Tapati Bandopadhyay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAACeUyQBFRZsyGm4kXA6S42AvqSKPn2Q6Z0)  
  
I oft get asked, ‘What skills should you pick up to become a data scientist?’
