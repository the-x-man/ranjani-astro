This is another brilliant book from Adam Grant.

In THINK AGAIN, Adam Grant brings together research and anecdotes to help us learn how to stay need to stay curious. It pushes us to reconsider, rethink, reevaluate and reimagine our beliefs, thoughts, and identities and get to the core of why we believe what we do

The core message of this book is to think like a scientist. Always seeking new information, challenging existing beliefs including your own, running experiments to test your hypotheses and being a lifelong learner.

It is a book about how we can get better at embracing the unknown and the joy of being wrong

I love Grant’s writing and this is a really engaging book.

Here are 4 parts I want to leave you with

Part 1 : Should we pursue happiness or purpose in life

Part 2 : What are the default mindsets we resort to when we think or talk? And why we should avoid them

Part 3: How to win debates and influence people?

Part 4 : Identity foreclosure and reconsidering our best laid out plans
