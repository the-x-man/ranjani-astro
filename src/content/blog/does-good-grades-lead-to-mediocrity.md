Good grades often lead to mediocrity in real life.

Parents want their kids to be the valedictorians – be top of the year since they are expected to do well in life.

In the book I am currently reading, “**Barking up the wrong tree**” the author, Eric questions the assumption.

In reality, that’s rarely the case, he says.

“Eric cites a study by Boston College, which tracked 81 valedictorians after their graduation in 1981\. 15 years later, they worked hard and learned a lot, but not a single one changed the world in earth-shattering ways.

Contrast that with the surprisingly large number of college dropouts on the Forbes 400 list, and an idea starts to emerge: maybe being good in school doesn’t matter so much, after all.”

Why is that, one would ask?

Doing well academically proves one thing: you’re good at following rules.

He says that, ‘Valedictorians typically settle into the system instead of shaking it up.’

“Schools reward being a generalist.

There is little recognition of student passion or expertise. The real world does the reverse.

They’re extremely well rounded and successful, personally and professionally, but they’ve never been devoted to a single area in which they put all their passion. That is not usually a recipe for eminence.”

Following the rules doesn’t create success; it just eliminates extremes—both good and bad. While this is usually good and all but eliminates downside risk, it also frequently eliminates earthshaking accomplishments.

So does it mean you don’t focus academically – I don’t think that is the point – the key is, being average is over.

True excellence and greatness (not just being good enough) comes from a mix of creativity, passion, obsession, vision, and commitment.

Personally, as the class topper, I can relate to what he states – something I struggle with with my daughter – between conforming to the rules/score good grades and letting her pursue her creativity.

Like she once asked me, ‘I don’t like it. Why should I only colour within the lines, Amma?’

How much do grades predict real world success?

What are your class toppers doing today?
