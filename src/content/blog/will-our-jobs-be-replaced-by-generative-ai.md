**#Day8**/30 **#30DaysofGenerativeAI**

During a gold rush, sell shovels

The content around **#GenerativeAI** is overwhelming. The FOMO is very real.

Are our jobs at stake, is the most common question I hear.

The short answer is – we don’t know we have unleashed until it plays out.

Having said that, the smartest thing you could do is second order thinking. Think beyond what is stated in the headlines.

Like [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) calls out in this [video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ranjanimani%5Fday8-30daysofgenerativeai-generativeai-activity-7042360115915620352-0Waw?utm%5Fsource=share&utm%5Fmedium=member%5Fdesktop),

“Most of the money made off the invention of refrigeration wasn’t by the makers, but companies like Coke. If AI/LLMs are refrigeration and the next Coca-Cola is to be built”

So rather than worry about whether your job will be replaced, think about how you can equip yourself to understand how you can work with technology better.

Because cliched though it sounds,

“AI will not replace you.

A person using AI will”
