How to compete when you donâ€™t have a winning start?

We shifted into a new neighbourhood when I was in 5th or 6th grade.

Thanks to my mom who worked with the state government, we were eligible to a nice housing quarters that came with a huge jackfruit-trees-laden backyard.

It also happened to be near one of the poshest neighbourhoods in the city.

As Dad and I drove down to the new place, we crossed a tree lined avenue with palatial bungalows and green laws.

I peeked out the window and remarked, â€˜Appa, who are these folks ? What do you need to work as to build houses like these?

Its so unfair that they are born to such massive advantage no? How can I compete with them?â€™

Dad, the always unperturbed one, guffawed out loud.

Donâ€™t compete on what you are different at. Maybe you compete on what all folks have in commonâ€™ â€“ Time, Health and Knowledge.

Maybe he made it in jest, but it one of those comments I thought about oft. I call them Levellers.

We are limited all in the time we have â€“ treat it as currency.

Nothing gives more ROI than your investment in sleep and what you eat.

And Technology today is the greatest leveller â€“ you can largely have access to information and people irrespective of where you sit or who you are

Getting past the unfairness of life that is not within our control is critical. Viewing yourself as a victim tends to keep you in the past and promotes a sense of powerlessness.

So here is a reminder to use the levellers to your advantage ðŸ™‚
