Why the best products are built from simple systems – Gall’s Law

“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.

A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.

You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system”

Oft, we come across multi-year plans for building complex systems, yet complex systems are full of variables and Interdependencies that must be arranged just right in order to function.

Nike started by reselling running shoes from a Japanese manufacturer. Today, Nike is the world’s largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel.

**Most successful products started from a simple idea, a small step, which later led to incremental improvements**

Here are 5 steps to consider when we build systems –

**#1Use** iterative processes.

**#2Reuse** known to be working modules.

**#3Release** early, release often.

**#4Use** automated testing to ensure that enhancing the system does not break it.

**#5Start** small and incrementally add changes – avoid building a one size fits all.

This applies – whether you are are startup building your roadmap or a tech/product leader designing your roadmap
