My ‘kid-in-a- candy-store-moment’

Last weekend, I managed to check off one of my bucket list items of getting a professional photoshoot done.

Thanks to being invited to [TANISHQ JEWLLERYS](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) launch of their new festive collection – like how cool is it to get to try out any of their gorgeous pieces!

Being the nerd that I am, my mom has been amused about my fascination with professional shoots and dramatics as much as I want to write a book.

‘What a disparate list of things you have on your bucket-list’, she jokes.

Well.

As Gaiman says, “You’re alive. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything.”
