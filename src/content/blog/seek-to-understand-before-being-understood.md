A long time ago, one of the teams I worked with, presented a kickass proposal to leadership

They had done all the due diligence, had data to back it up and had a clear strategy and roadmap.

Yet, it did not fly (or land?)

One of the key reasons, that was later uncovered, was not the fault with the solution in itself.

But in whether all key decision makers were aligned with where the problem existed.

Solutioning for something without seeking clarity on whether the decision makers are on the same page with respect to the problem, the extent or the urgency is a primary cause of dysfunction across teams.

So when you see something not working, before you figure out how to fine-tune the solution, question alignment on your problem statement.

A lot of candidates I speak to, during hiring, tend to focus on ways to optimise the solution.

Seek to understand before being understood â€“ an underrated leadership trait.
