The first thing that struck me when I spoke to [Kapil](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) was his downright humility and sense of self reflection – a trait I hugely value in a leader.

So much so that by the end of the 30 mins, we were chatting about mental health impact on women, almost as if I knew him longer than I actually did.

It’s an honor to host [Kapil Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Chief Transformation Officer at Microsoft in Episode 5 of **#PIVOT** **#LeaderTalks** 

Join us tomorrow as we chat about –

– Scaling effectively as you grow

– Influencing without authority

– Driving cultural change

– Acknowledging and addressing the significance of mental health, specifically in working women.
