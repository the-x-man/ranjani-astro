**#Day10**/30 **#30DaysofGenerativeAI**

Hot on the heels of GPT4, [Runway](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) launches Gen2 – text prompts to video capabilities.

Gen 2 is a multi-modal AI system that can generate novel videos with text, images, or video clips.

Essentially, ‘If you can say it, you can see it’

What does it allow you to do?

It allows capabilities across 8 different modes from text to video, to video from text and images. It also allows for rendering and stylization.

Runway says it’ll be making its new generative video model, Gen-2, available to users in ‘the coming weeks.’

For context, “Runway offers a web-based video editor that specializes in AI tools like background removal and pose detection. The company helped develop open-source text-to-image model Stable Diffusion and announced its first AI video editing model, Gen-1, in February”

An example video generated by Runway’s Gen-2 model. – The text input prompt was “A shot following a hiker through jungle brush”
