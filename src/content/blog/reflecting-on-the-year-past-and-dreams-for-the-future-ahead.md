Reflecting on the year that is past, I was thinking about all that I wish to be in the year to come.

Not goals, but the person I want to be, the people I want to meet, the things I want to make, ‘dreaming dangerously and outrageously’ and the unknowns I want to step into, even if I am faking it.

Like Neil Gaiman says, ‘Try to make your time matter: minutes and hours and days and weeks can blow away like dead leaves, with nothing to show but time you spent not quite ever doing things, or time you spent waiting to begin.’

Who is it that you want to be in the new year?
