A business moat is a key competitive advantage that sets a company apart from its competitors.

It is what keeps has helped the biggest companies build and defend their markets

From Amazon and Tesla to Starbucks and Coinbase, here are the common types of moats.

**#1** Network Effects – The more users it has, the more useful it gets. Think marketplace, social networks, data and platform.

**#2** Cost Moats – Think switching costs, sunk costs and cost advantages (ex – Walmart)

**#3** Cultural Moats – Brand and what it stands for. Patagonia is a cult favorite in this category

**#4** Resource Moats – Think IP, Knowledge or regulatory. Healthcare, Financial services and Crypto benefit hugely here,

Here is one of my favorite – own the platform, own the network
