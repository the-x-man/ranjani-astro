How to be more productive – 3 Tips you can try this week

**#The** Idea Dump : I learnt this first from [James Altucher](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) who recommends carrying a notebook to capture all the thoughts and ideas that cross your mind.

Over time, he says, you train your brain to become an ‘idea machine’

**#2Important** vs the Urgent : When listing stuff to do for the day, I time box it into important and the urgent tasks.

Usually we tend to focus on the urgent tasks and ignore important (and usually longer gratification items – ex, Fitness, Up skilling or understanding the business domain)

**#Tune** out when doing deep work.

You tend to accomplish more in 2 hours of deep-work vs a day of distracted focus.

[Naval Ravikant](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) calls this ‘work like a lion instead of grazing like a cow’

[Rajan Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) recommends to keep your phones at arm’s distance, switch off notifications and check mails (or slack ) only at pre-defined intervals.

Book recommendation on the topic – Cal Newport’s Deep Work
