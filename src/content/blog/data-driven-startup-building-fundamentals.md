I was talking to a start-up founder and was pleasantly surprised at how data informed their decisions were.

There seems to be largely two kinds of startup founders –

One who trusts data driven/data informed product building.

And then those who use data and analytics as an after thought.

As a founder, you get to choose where you focus on – and when used right, data informed product building can be truly a competitive advantage

And this isn’t about using shiny new toys or algorithms but to get fundamentals right –

**#1** Well defined North-star metrics and success framework – Aligned to your company’s core mission. Example, is that ‘daily or weekly active usage’ if you are growth focused? Avoid too many metrics and/or vanity metrics.

**#2** Engagement <> Stickiness : Are your customers returning because of notification or through their own volition? Do you have metrics tracking that. What is a meaningful product interaction?

**#3** Retention – How does your quick ratio look like? Do you look at retained and win-back cohorts over time? If you have net positive growth but very few of them are retained, then product doesn’t seem to have a core value prop and is acquiring users through growth hacking probably…

**#4** How do you measure health – Across growth, user adoption, market metrics and retention

**#5** Segmentation – Are you monitoring growth across multiple dimensions that are relevant to your business?

What has been your focus as a start-up founder in making data assets your competitive advantage?
