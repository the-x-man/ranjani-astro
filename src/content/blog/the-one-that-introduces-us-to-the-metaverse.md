The book that introduced us to the original Metaverse

‘Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza in real life, but in the Metaverse he’s a warrior prince.

Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that’s striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse’

It isn’t an easy read.

Absolutely not. It paints a world so outrageous yet believable.

It takes you through a journey that requires you to stay invested – an unsteady narrative with overwhelming information

It makes Neuromancer seem like a Kindergarten book

A kaleidoscope of a sci-fi nightmare, social criticism and a bereft society, it intrigues me like none other

Sci-fi influences art influences reality

If you are a fan of the genre, as Naval says, make this one of the books you read.
