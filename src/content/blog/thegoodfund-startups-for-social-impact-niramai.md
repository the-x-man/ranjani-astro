I have been researching Startups in Tech driving Social Impact

Potentially backed by Women in Tech

It brings together all that I am passionate about

– Live your potential, no matter where you are

– And Leveraging Tech for Good to Drive Social Impact

My hope is, at some point in the future, to start a VC fund directed at **#StartupsforSocialImpact** – **#TheGoodFund**

Towards that, as I learn more, here is my weekly series to amplify the startups that are already paving inroads in this space

[Geetha Manjunath](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is the CEO of Niramai, the Bangalore-based deep-tech startup addressing critical healthcare problems through automated solutions.

Their mission is to create a Universal Cancer Screening Method that can save lives.

NIRAMAI Health Analytix is a Bangalore-based deep-tech startup addressing critical healthcare problems through automated solutions.

“One of the most common method to diagnose the earliest signs of cancer is Thermography.

However, interpreting a thermal image can be error prone as there are about 4,00,000 colour points for every person.

Niramai offers solutions which enables automated analysis and in better interpretation of thermal images, using AI.

Niramai or ‘Non-Invasive Risk Assessment with Machine Intelligence’ has developed an early breast cancer detection technology that is a radiation-free and non-invasive. 

Maybe someday I can sit with [Geetha Manjunath](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) to learn her story behind why she started Niramai.
