What comes to your mind when you think of Innovation?

Disruptive products like iPhones?

Drones? Neuralink’s Brain Machine Interfaces?

While all of those are fabulous examples indeed, they are just one flavor of innovation – \*Evolutionary\* innovation.

Thinking of Innovation as also being \*Incremental\* allows us to constantly push boundaries and create better products

Can we create re-usable artifacts that can be used across data science projects?

Do you enable your teams with optimizes processes, data and tech to allow data scientists to do what they do best

Can you have agile frameworks that allows teams to cohesively work together

This is the premise behind Principle 7 – The need to develop many flavors of innovation

It is part of IDEO’s former partner [Diego Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s 21 principles for Innovation.

Do you have an example of incremental innovation?
