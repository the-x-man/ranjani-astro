“Our genes are a predisposition, but our genes are not our fate”

‘Health’ and how can we live better – that is the theme of books I am reading this month.

This is one of those best sellers that I have been meaning to read since I switched to a Whole Plant based diet last November.

Dr Dean Ornish is a pioneer of lifestyle medicine and uses studies to show that lifestyle changes are often actually better than drugs and surgery in treating and even reversing many of the most prevalent chronic diseases.

The premise is simple. He has 4 steps as part of his health program  
#1 Eat well: a whole foods, plant-based diet naturally low in fat and sugar and high in flavor.  
#2 Move more: moderate exercise such as walking  
#3 Stress less: including meditation and gentle yoga practices  
#4 Love more: how love and intimacy transform loneliness into healing  
The “Ornish diet” has been rated “#1 for Heart Health” by U.S. News & World Report every year from 2011 to 2017\.   
Dr Ornish’s take that the medical fraternity has been focussed on curing symptoms with drugs and very rarely do they focus on root-cause which is driven by nutrition.

Yes, there are views to the contrary but the book is backed with research and findings that is quite worth a read.

While I would refrain from providing recommendations since it involves health, personally I have benefitted tremendously with a switch to a whole foods diet. Not to mention losing 10 Kilos in 3 months.  
Please make diet changes only after consulting your physician.

Do you have book recommendations I can add to the Health theme?
