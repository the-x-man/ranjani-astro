Ajay was a lead I had in one of my early roles.

Razor-sharp and focussed – he truly emulated the paradigm – “Work like a lion rather than graze like a cow”

I recall him telling me to optimise for energy vs time

That as a morning person, he started his day quite early – and got most of his work done within the first 4 hours of the day.

Post which he usually met folks or looked at non-critical tasks, if any.

He left office at 5 sharp to hit the gym, meet friends and call it an early night.

A lot has been said last week around ‘Quiet Quitting’

Here is an article that manages to take a balanced view at interpreting the Tik Tok trend

As the interview puts it, “Quiet quitting doesn’t actually involve quitting. It confused me when I first heard of the term as well. Instead, it’s been deemed a response to hustle culture and burnout. Employees are, I guess, quitting going above and beyond, declining to do the tasks that they are not being paid for. “

What are your thoughts on the trend?
