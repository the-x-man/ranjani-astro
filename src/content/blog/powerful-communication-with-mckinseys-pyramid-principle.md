I was scrolling through my LinkedIn feed, when I came across this concept called the Minto Pyramid Principle.

_[Minto Pyramid Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Minto-Pyramid-Principle-Writing-Thinking/dp/0960191038)_, also referred to as the **McKinsey’s _Pyramid Principle_**, is a tool used to process and structure large amounts of information to convey a story, message or presentation without omitting important details.

 A concept which is apparently a widely used management paradigm.

**Background** – It is a framework on structured thinking conceptualised by Barbara Minto. Used widely by consultants. Based on the book – **The Minto Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing, Thinking and Problem Solving**.

**What** – Your success highly depends on how well you can communicate your ‘story’

**How** – Structure your thoughts and communication in the below format

* Situation (state of affairs)
* Complication (what is changing to make things harder)
* Question (That the situation and complication demands)
* Answer (One’s particularly ingenious solution)

With the solution stated, one spends the rest of the time providing evidence and arguments supporting the statement. It is thus a pyramid.

The answer is thus the most important thing in the room – not the status quo or the as-is. Each level of the pyramid supports the level above.  
Evidence supports Arguments and arguments support answer.  
Finally it helps remove unnecessary information.

If a fact doesn’t support the answer then it is removed. It thus removed the noise that prevents one from getting to one’s goal.

Life lessons : This, I believe, would work beyond consultative presentations and in life in itself. Having a constant focus on the outcome vs the output moves us from being constantly ‘busy’ to productive in what we seek to achieve.
