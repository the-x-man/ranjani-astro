The Promise is a 2021 Booker prize winner

A story of a dysfunctional White South African family

And its disintegration over time

Of a promise made to their Black maid that takes 30 years to acknowledge

That weaves together the narrative of the changing political system underlying it

“Galgut depicts a family that has no close links with each other, Amor cannot stomach her morally bankrupt and lost family, squandering their opportunities and dreams, the marital infidelities, the humiliations, the drinking, and the self deceptions.

She refuses to benefit financially and makes no attempt to keep in touch. Religion, including the New Age aspects, is portrayed as ambitious, hypocritical, overly judgemental, power hungry and sinning.

The fragile and tenuous connections between the family is reflected in the threads holding South Africa together, from the hope displayed at the Rugby World Cup, to the deep fractures, the rising crime, and the compromised integrity in the years that follow.”

I oft pause to draw parallels to the political and caste systems that I am more familiar with and smile

For hegemony is a truth that seems as universal as time

It isn’t an easy read. Albeit a powerful one.

“Waiting in respectful silence is an essential part of the job and he has developed the capacity to simulate deep calm while experiencing none of it. In his core, Mervyn Glass is a frantic man.”

What is your current read?
