AI singularity refers to an event where the AI either become self aware, or reach an ability for continuous improvement so powerful that it will evolve beyond our control’

It may be a far way out but one ponders about whether there will be a human advantage in a world disrupted by artificial intelligence?

That is the question that this book seeks to address. The question then is – “what uniquely human traits can help us deal with the challenges of the future and harness technology to our advantage”

Framing

“To frame is to make a mental model that enables us to see patterns, predict how things will unfold, and make sense of new situations.

Frames guide the decisions we make and the results we attain. Science has long focused on traits like memory and reasoning leaving framing all but ignored.

But with computers becoming better at some of those cognitive tasks, framing stands out as a critical function–and only humans can do it. This book is the first guide to mastering this innate human ability”

On that note, so many books, so little time. In an alternate universe, I might choose to be a librarian
