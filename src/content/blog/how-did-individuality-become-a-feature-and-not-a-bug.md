How did individuality become a feature and not a bug?  
“The top-earning writer on the paid newsletter platform Substack earns more than $500,000 a year from reader subscriptions”  
  
  
“The age of creator economy is upon us.  
  
No longer just happy endorsing other brands, creators and influencers are monetizing their huge social media following by launching products—from sandwiches to make-up lines— to reach their audiences directly.  
  
The advent of creators has spawned a whole new economy, one that is at a nascent stage in India but looks all set to grow”  
  
The image below gives the monetization methods beyond ads  
  
Take Outschool, an online marketplace for live video classes in which teachers are predominantly former school teachers and stay-at-home parents.  
  
“These stories are indicative of a larger trend: call it the “creator stack” or the “enterprization of consumer.” Whereas previously, the biggest online labor marketplaces flattened the individuality of workers, new platforms allow anyone to monetize unique skills”  
  
How do see the ‘accessible-to-all’ democratic nature of the new platforms and the new gig economy impact the future of work?
