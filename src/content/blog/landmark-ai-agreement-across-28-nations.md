Landmark AI declaration by 28 countries

  
Leading AI nations including US, India and China “have reached a world-first agreement at Bletchley Park establishing a shared understanding of the opportunities and risks posed by frontier AI” yesterday

  
The Bletchley Declaration sets out agreement from 28 nations that there is “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the most significant capabilities of these AI models.”

  
It set out a “two-pronged agenda focused on identifying risks of shared concern and building the scientific understanding of them, and also building cross-country policies to mitigate them”

  
#1“This includes, alongside increased transparency by private actors developing frontier AI capabilities, appropriate evaluation metrics, tools for safety testing, and developing relevant public sector capability and scientific research,” the declaration said.

  
It ‘encouraged transparency and accountability from actors developing frontier AI technology on their plans to measure, monitor and mitigate potentially harmful capabilities’

  
As part of agreeing a forward process for international collaboration on frontier AI safety, The Republic of Korea has agreed to co-host a mini virtual summit on AI in the next 6 months.

  
Why is this a significant step?

  
As an independent journalist shared, “For the first time we now have countries agreeing that we need to look not just independently but collectively at the risks around frontier AI.”

  
“AI knows no borders, and its impact on the world will only deepen”
