Playing the long game

In my first job, I ended up weeping in the restroom within the first 3 months

My team lead was a stickler for writing good code and rightly so. He added comments like a pro.

The first time he reviewed mine, he edited, formatted and deleted parts of it. He didnâ€™t admonish me for it â€“ just continued to format it while calling out how â€˜our code is our legacyâ€™.

As I stood behind his chair looking at him editing comments, I felt such a sheer sense of insufficiency at failing at the task that tears welled up in my eyes.

Now, rather than think of it as an opportunity, I castigated myself for how I should have done better.

We are taught to score marks and top subjects at school, but hardly to take failures as learning opportunities.

I wasnâ€™t used to failing at college and thought it would extend to real life.

The incident seems hilarious now but hindsight is always 20/20 and [Prathap](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)â€˜s amazing note about careers reminded me of this.

Careers are a marathon and not a sprint.

So if you are having a bad day or have messed up â€“ thatâ€™s all right, everyone does.

Confidence doesnâ€™t come from not failing â€“ but by accepting oneâ€™s limits, learning each day and playing to your strengths

Something you realise over time ðŸ™‚

So chin up and play the long game.
