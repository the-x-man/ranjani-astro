“Where do you want to be in 10 years” is a popular interview question.

One that I have always had concerns with.

Here are some serious drawbacks with that 10 year plan – the world around you isn’t static.

2022 isn’t a linear progression of 2012.

So what do you do?

“If you want to seize the new opportunities and meet the challenges in today’s landscape, you need to think and act like you’re running a startup:

Your career”

That is the TL-DR version of the new podcast I stumbled upon that I quite love – [Reid Hoffman](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Ben Casnocha](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s

‘The Startup of You’

I picked up the title based on the same concept recently.

Here is advice from the book that can help plan your 2032

**#1** “Your identity is not found through introspection but rather emerges through experimentation”

**#2** “Entrepreneurial career planning is about being flexibly persistent: always ready to adapt, but also persistent in driving towards set goals.

**#3** They call this ABZ planning

Plan A: What you’re doing now. Your current implementation of your competitive advantage.

Plan B: What you pivot to when you need to change either your goal or the route for getting there.

Plan Z: The fallback position. Your lifeboat if your plan fails and you need to reload before getting back in the game. The certainty of Plan Z is what allows you to take on uncertainty and risk in your plans A and B.

There is no set way to think about your career – there is more than one framework they recommend to how you want to grow

On that topic – how do you think about your career planning?
