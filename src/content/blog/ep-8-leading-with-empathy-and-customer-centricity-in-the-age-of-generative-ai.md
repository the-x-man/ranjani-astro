Understanding the ‘3T framework’ and what is enabling tech ecosystem in India

**#Ep8** – Leading with Empathy and customer centricity in the age of Generative AI

In this exciting new episode of **#GenerativeAIandI**, I am excited to host [Sanket Atal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Managing Director – Salesforce India Operations, Site Lead – Technology/Marketing/Product.

With 29+ years of experience across firms such as Informix, Oracle, CA Tech, MakeMyTrip (E-commerce), and Intuit, working in the US and India with geographically distributed teams, Sanket’s deep tech experience is evident across the discussion

I love the passion he has towards startups and innovation, customer centricity driving mindful leadership and building diverse and inclusive workplaces

An engineering at heart, Sanket chats about the 3 T framework that is enabling the tech ecosystem, how to build AI first products with innovation whilst focussing on customer centricity with a focus on data governance and security
