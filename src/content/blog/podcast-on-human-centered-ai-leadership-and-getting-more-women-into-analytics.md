[Chitra Gurjar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA8CHoBclXblc9YDRlsyMllBd1bhFIcpTs) and I recently had a great conversation on her podcast â€˜Software People Storiesâ€™ about a myriad topicsâ€¦.

Human-centered AI and Tech, leadership, how product management complements my analytics role, being comfortable with ambiguityâ€¦. to my dad who will always my north-star

and of-course books!

And most importantly a topic that I increasingly realize is part of my core value and passion â€“ Daring Greatly and enabling other women to take charge of their lives.

Absolutely nothing â€“ not where you hail from or your gender should define what one can or cannot do
