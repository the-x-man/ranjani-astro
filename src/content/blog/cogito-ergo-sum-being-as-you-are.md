I thought this was a great reminder.

Growing up, I constantly struggled with anxiety of not doing enough. Of not being enough.

Maybe it was the pressure to prove myself to my parents. Or probably self-inflicted.

But there was this constant voice at the back of my head.

Not smart enough. Not pretty enough. Not social enough. Could have connected the dots better. Should have tried harder.

A lot of ‘what if’s’, could have’s , should have’s and mentors later, I realize the futility of it all.

Much later, I came across the Atlas complex when I was doing an [IDEO](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) course.

The Atlas complex : Any time I worked on leading change, I have \[I realize now\] unintentionally, carried the weight of the change on my shoulder.

It is hugely liberating to understand that we can harness the collective energy to take action and not have to suffer from the Atlas complex.

So yeah, if you are questioning yourself – you are enough. As you are.
