**#ScalewithGenerativeAI** Part2 – How to talk to VCs

Speak the language of the person at the other end of the table.

I spoke to this really smart co-founder with 20+ years of technical expertise in AI security.

Brilliant guy who is working on building a curated bespoke platform.

Start with what it means to the customer – Why should they buy you and what do you solve with AI.
