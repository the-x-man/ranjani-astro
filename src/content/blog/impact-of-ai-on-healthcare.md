Way back in 2002, my dad’s physicians missed a medical anomaly

Which if flagged earlier, it might have given him more years

It wasn’t intentional but a product of how our burgeoning healthcare systems are set up – not always optimised for patient enablement

Tech could help with that

And that is why, of all the use-cases of Gen AI, the one I would put my money on and passionate to learn more about is Healthcare

As a [Boston Consulting Group (BCG)](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) paper called out, “Generative AI won’t replace the doctor-patient relationship. But it will make doctors—along with pharmaceutical companies, med-techs, and other health care organizations—even better at what they do”

The speaker highlights the use-case of how it took 40 years to develop a drug for Tuberculosis – why? “Because it wasn’t a disease in the priority markets”

“With AI you could de-risk and improve the development cycles…. Which means you will bring the right products to the right people much more quickly than before”

Pharma Companies use AI to –

**#Accelerate** the process of generating new protein and drug molecules by 10X

**#Reduce** time spent on admin processes by 50%

Check out the paper in comments around the other use cases across healthcare

Have you come across a sector or use case leveraging GenAI for good?
