Can Food Waste be a preventable problem?

What if one could increase the shelf life of vegetables and fruits we consume?

How much of economic waste would that help tackle?

[GreenPod Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) states that 40% of the vegetables and fruits are lost due to spoilage/over ripening.

As an Agri-biotech company they are working on sustainable solutions to minimise agricultural food waste in India.

How?

Through patented active packaging tech that can extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables.

The product comprises natural plant extracts that can activate a defense mechanism within a fruit or vegetable to slow down the ripening rate and minimize the microbial attack at ambient temperatures

The product has been tested by NABL certified labs to prove there is zero residue of the product on the crop after use and doesnâ€™t impact the nutrition in any negative form. T

The company is working with more than 25+ customers to run product trials and validations for the last 6 months.

I have been quite attracted towards startups working on sustainability and clean tech.

My hope is, at some point in the future, to start a VC fund directed at **#StartupsforSocialImpact** â€“ **#TheGoodFund**

Towards that, as I learn more, here is my weekly series to amplify tech and circular eco startups that are already paving inroads in this space.
