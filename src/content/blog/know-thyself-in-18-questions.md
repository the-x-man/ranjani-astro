_‘Ask better questions_‘ is a precept I like to think that I live by.

 On that note, I came across this list of ‘[18 thought provoking questions that will free your mind](http://www.marcandangel.com/2017/12/31/18-thought-provoking-questions-that-will-free-your-mind-in-2018/)‘ by Mark Chernoff. 

Naive though that sounds, I did find some of the questions making me uncomfortable (which must be a good thing). So here is taking a shot at them, under a time limit, to ensure I do not fake a ‘sounds-better’ response. Also I think I’d like to revisit this oft to see how my responses vary and where my moral compass points to, over time

1. **In one sentence, who are you?** \[Yesterday I came across this hard-hitting note – “In 1962, Clare Boothe Luce, on of the first women to serve in the U.S. Congress, offered some advice to President John F. Kennedy. ‘A _great man_,’ she told him, ‘is _one sentence_.’ Abraham Lincoln’s _sentence_ was: ‘He preserved the union and freed the slaves.’\] – “I am a lifelong learner and I want to use knowledge to make a difference to my life and to the lives of those around me”
2. **In one word, what do you live for?** – Passion
3. **What is worth the pain?** – Knowing that you will come out a better person at the end of it.
4. **What will you never give up on?** – Integrity
5. **What do you always try to avoid?** – Altercations, even if at times, it may be required to be in disagreement.
6. **What’s is something that you take for granted every day?** – That the family would stand by me. Rock steady. At all times.
7. **What do you need most right now?** – Kindness to myself. Patience towards others.
8. **What would you immediately do differently if you knew no one would judge you?** – Try new stuff – such as modeling, maybe
9. **What is something nobody could ever steal from you?** Memories – real and made-up.
10. **Who would you like to forgive right now?** My younger self – I am quite harsh on how I judge my 20 year old self in having taken the decisions that she did.
11. **Happiness is not?** White Sugar
12. **What impact do you want to leave on the people you love?** That I tried.
13. **Life is too short to tolerate?** Gas lighting
14. **What is something that used to scare you, but no longer does?** Approaching strangers and exploring strange new ideas
15. **What do you want to remember forever?** My dad’s look of pride
16. **What do you always look forward to?** A good book and better conversations
17. **What recently reminded you of how fast the time flies?** Aging school friends
18. **What’s something everyone should be able to say before they die?** I didn’t regret that

I think I’d leave this here to remind myself the next time I take this the next year.
