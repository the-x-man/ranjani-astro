On Friday, Musk unveiled the manifestation of most sci-fi novels – Tesla Bot, a humanoid robot  
  
More than what the bot’s capabilities is to understand what this implies to us and the future of the world if this does succeed and scale  
  
“Our cars are like semi-sentient computers on wheels’ And that is the basis he says of what is in a humanoid form that prototypes next year.  
  
It is intended to be friendly and ‘eliminate dangerous, repetitive and boring tasks’  
  
Adding that “we’re setting it up, in a mechanical way, in a physical way, so that you can run away from it and most likely overpower it’  
  
For example ‘It should be able to please go to the store and get some groceries’  
  
[#What](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=what&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6834775248601251840) does it imply?  
  
“This would be quite profound because if we say what is the economy, then it is at the foundation, labor.  
So what happens when there is no shortage of labor? Because in the long term, there is going to be Universal Basic Income  
  
Essentially in the future physical work will be a choice. And it has profound implications for the economy because if the foundation of economy is labor then capital equipment is just distilled labor.  
  
Is there then any actual limit to the economy, maybe not”  
  
Love it or not, the future is going to look very different from the one you or I grew up in.  
  
If you were to be in a world where you don’t need to work for livelihood, what would it mean to you?
