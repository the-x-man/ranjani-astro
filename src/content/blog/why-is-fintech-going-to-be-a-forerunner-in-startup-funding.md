Driven by Gen Z and Millennials, Fintech start-ups are a fore-runner in startups funding

There are 5,010 FinTech startups in India

This is a sector I anticipate will further accelerate.

Here are extracts from a brilliant article extending this argument around why

**#1GenZ**‘ expectation around Finance has changed from their parents gen

…”This generation has embraced mobile banking and fintech in a way that previous generations did not.

And they grew up in the wake of the last financial crisis, so perhaps they don’t have the same unwavering trust in institutions as their parents did. They’re often more leery of debt and credit, as we see younger consumers preferring debit to credit cards. And they grew up with the internet. So all this seems to set the stage for the rise of fintech serving this particular market”

**#2What** is the advice for Fintech startup founders if they are building financial products for the increasingly savvy digital gen?

“a transparent business model. Being clear about how you’re making money and making sure that your incentives are aligned with your customer in the short and long term”

Thoughts on what other sectors would drive growth in the startup ecosystem?
