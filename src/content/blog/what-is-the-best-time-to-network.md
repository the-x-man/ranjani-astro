When is the best time to network?

When you don’t need to.

We default to staying within our cohorts

Teams. Age. Domain. Geographies. Expertise.

As you talk to people at your company beyond your teams, in your industry or even outside your field of interest, you uncover connections and opportunities accelerating your learning.

You can connect the dots faster

It makes you noticeable and increased your creative intellect

And when you decide to start – do not start by asking for favors.

Be authentic – Start with Giving and Being Curious.

With a mindset to learn and offer value.

That is how I found most of my mentors – there are some genuinely nice people out there.

So where can you start?

Block your Friday afternoons to have at least one conversation with someone new within your organizations.

Play the long term game.
