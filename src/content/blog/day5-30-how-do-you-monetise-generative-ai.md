How do you Monetise Generative AI?

The current state of Generative AI exists because of the depth of engineering and capabilities of LLMs and Image generation models.But will they continue to reap the benefits?

The a16z report I was reading though makes an interesting point though – ‘Model providers invented generative AI, but haven’t reached large commercial scale’

**#1Closed** source models cannot maintain their edge indefinitely – Models released as open source can be hosted by anyone, including outside companies that don’t bear the costs associated with large-scale model training (that is very expensive). 

**#2Is** commercialization likely to be tied to hosting. 

“Demand for proprietary APIs (e.g. from OpenAI) is growing rapidly. Hosting services for open-source models (e.g. Hugging Face) are emerging as useful hubs to easily share and integrate models”

**#Integration** into use cases at the point of consumption

Example, ‘incorporation of generative AI into Internet search engines. Why? Because it might drive more people to a particular search engine’

Or Integration into existing product Portfolio such as what Microsoft is doing with Azure Open AI services

What is happening today?

“One approach consists of charging people a fee such as a monthly subscription or a per transaction charge when using generative AI. Whether people will be willing to pay for generative AI is still unknown. Some will, some won’t.”

What are the other ways this could pan out?

Product Placement embedded into Generative AI. This interesting Forbes article – Should generative AI such as ChatGPT make use of product placement ads? – which brings forth challenges around AI Ethics.

Bottomline, it is an ever evolving space – those who own a large portion of the tech stack and get the flywheel of engagement-value right will accrue benefits.
