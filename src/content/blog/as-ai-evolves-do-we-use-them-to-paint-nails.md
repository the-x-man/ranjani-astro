Just because you can doesn’t mean you should

AI is evolving. And it is painting nails.

My cousin who is on Instagram recently showed me a video of a robot manicurist

An AI based system that uses ‘sophisticated algorithms which determine how the nozzle should move to deposit nail polish in the right places”

Again, I say this as an observation and not a judgement – as we develop AI systems, where should we use them?

To make more accurate nail painting or better french fries?

Watching Shark Tank, I oft wonder how the seemingly ridiculous contraptions pick up million USD cheques.

Maybe the middle class upbringing doesn’t let me comprehend why one would spend 20 USD on a beer can that doubles up as a fishing rod.

Nonetheless, money, tends to flow where there is demand.

And as long as there are customers willing to pay, there are always going to be products to cater to them – whimsical as it may sound.

Which is probably why the new slew of entrepreneurs building for social impact makes me so happy.

Maybe, some day, if I become a VC – I would fund entrepreneurs in Web3 who build to democratize tech and drive social impact.

For the world doesn’t have to be zero sum game.
