What separates those who make it to the top from others?

Have you wondered why each of us who begin at the same starting line navigate different trajectories through life?

And what choices make them different. Can we really learn to make better choices?

When I considered doing a **#LeaderTalk** series pre-Covid one of the first people I thought of talking to was the extraordinary [Pankaj Rai (He/Him/His)](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

No better time than his birthday to post an excerpt from the recording!

Pankaj, who is currently the Chief Data Analytics Office at Aditya Birla was one of my earliest bosses and has continued to be a mentor and guide.

I love his sass, his philosophical outlook to life and a larger than life network! He is, as someone put, it a ‘serial giver’ – connecting people to one another.

Inversion is a mental model that talks about using the strategy of avoiding bad decisions.

For example, say you want to improve innovation in your organization. Thinking forward, you’d think about all of the things you could do to foster innovation. If you look at the problem by inversion, however, you’d think about all the things you could do that would discourage innovation. Ideally, you’d avoid those things.

So how do we make better choices?

Listen to Pankaj talk about choices that helped navigate his career.
