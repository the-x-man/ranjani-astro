What makes a CEO?

[Mastercard](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s former CEO Ajay Banga, shared his game changing vision, in the book CEO Excellence.

“I was walking through the office and saw the slogan written in a staircase : ‘Mastercard, the Heart of Commerce”.

It made me think, ‘But commerce is mostly in cash, right?’ I realised nobody in the company talked about cash.

If anything, they talked about Visa and Amex and other local schemes.

“That led me to figure out the % of transactions in the world that were happening in cash. That number exceeded 85% just for consumer transactions. From then on I talked about our vision as being to ‘kill cash’.

Instead of fighting for a piece of the 15% of transactions that were electronic, we fought for a piece of the 85% that weren’t (yet).

So one of the traits the book recommends makes a successful CEO is how they ‘reframed what winning meant for their companies’.

They didn’t just raise the aspiration levels, they changed the definition of success.

Personally, I feel being a CEO isn’t just a title but a mindset of how one operates – from setting the vision and culture, mobilising the teams to managing one’s time and energy.

Yes, one can aspire to be a CEO (like I hope to, some day) but you don’t need the title to think and work like one.

The book lists the below 6 responsibilities of the CEO.

What do you think are the trait(s) that drive the CEO’s you admire?
