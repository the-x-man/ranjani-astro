“It’s not in anyone’s best interest to work from home, and corporate leaders should be telling their employees to get back into the office so they can “feel part of something,” wrote writer Malcolm Gladwell.

Stirring up a hornet’s nest.

One can see why work from anywhere can be such a compelling proposition.

While on a vacation recently, I managed to catch a couple of hours of deep work to wrap up a presentation for an upcoming conference.

Let alone the lowered cost of living and flexibility, just the sheer joy of working amidst nature is a huge win.

As an HBR article called out, “…if leaders support synchronous and asynchronous communication, brainstorming, and problem-solving; lead initiatives to codify knowledge online; encourage virtual socialization, team building, and mentoring; invest in and enforce data security; work with government stakeholders to ensure regulatory compliance; and set an example by becoming WFA employees themselves, all-remote organizations may indeed emerge as the future of work”

All of that is easier said than done – there are definitely multiple tactical issues such as good connectivity, access to teams across time-zones to cultural mindset and assumed goodwill to be solved for.

Most of all, opening up remote work has allowed us to open doors for a global workforce

And like a mentor once told me –

“Well, it’s the most democratising thing to happen – levelling the playing field.

I don’t need to forcibly socialise or worry about missing networking during smoke breaks”.

What do you think is required for WFA/Hybrid work to succeed?
