Warning: Humans cannot reliably detect speech deepfakes

A study published earlier this month found that humans can only detect deepfake speech 73% of the time.

Listeners only correctly spotted the deepfakes 73% of the time, and there was no difference in detectability between the two languages tested – English and Mandarin.

Speech deepfakes are artificial voices generated by machine learning models. Due to rapid research progress, it is possible to produce a realistic-sounding clone using only a few audio samples

What does this imply?

“As speech synthesis algorithms improve and become more realistic, we can expect the detection task to become harder.

The difficulty of detecting speech deepfakes confirms their potential for misuse and signals that defenses against this threat are needed”

What do you think are potential means to tackle this?
