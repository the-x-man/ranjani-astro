One of these pieces is AI generated. And the other, human.  
  
Will AI replace writing?  
A long time ago, a person reached out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) with a compelling proposition  
  
â€˜You seem to write regularly on LinkedIn, have a full time job and are a parent. You must find it hard to find timeâ€™, he sympathised  
  
â€˜That true. But you tend to find time to do what you are passionate aboutâ€™, I replied.  
  
â€˜We are starting an agency that ghost writes for folks. We analysed your content and wrote posts for you around tech â€“ a topic you write a lot about,â€™ he offered.  
  
At first glance, to his due credit, it was factually well written content. What troubled me was not just outsourcing an area of passion â€“ but more-so the fact that, the writing didnâ€™t seem to be â€˜meâ€™.  
  
People have a signature over what they produce â€“ include how they write.  
Over time, you can even recognise if your friend isnâ€™t the one chatting with you.  
  
That is what makes writing unique â€“ not just stringing together a set of words but evoking an emotion.  
  
And that explains why I am largely positive about how [#generativeAI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=generativeai&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7029753044170924032), if used well, will not just be net positive in helping our kids learn but also complement human force.  
  
Not replace it.  
  
Here is [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Eddie Shleyner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAgt0aUB9WFTLInmf0DGeZprFtq-pKk5WgI)â€˜s very topical example â€“  
â€˜Can you describe meeting your first childâ€™.  
  
Which response do you think is AI generated?
