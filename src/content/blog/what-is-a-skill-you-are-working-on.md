“Perhaps the most critical communication skill – Be brief.

Use as few words as possible to say what you need, and everyone will appreciate it.

After writing every sentence it helps to ask “Would the reader still get my point if I deleted that line?”

Not “Does that sentence make sense?” Millions of unnecessary sentences make sense.

Treating words like they cost you something is the right mindset.

A writer once recommended imagining someone pays you $100 for every word you remove from your draft. Another quipped: “Leave out the parts readers tend to skip.”

Poor communicators ramble. Good communicators leave out unnecessary details.

Great communicators treat words as the scarcest commodity.”

This is one the three rare skills that [Morgan Housel](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) calls out in his blog.

It is a skill I still work on. My default has been to explain my position.

Part of being a good communicator, I realise, is to be clear about what you want to communicate.

Even before you utter it out loud.

What is a skill you are working on improving?
