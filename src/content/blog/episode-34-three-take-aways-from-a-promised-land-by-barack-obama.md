Today we are going to talk about one of the most highly anticipated books of 2020.  
The presidential memoir – A Promised Land – Barack Obama

I love this genre – biographies/autobiographies

It is almost like taking a peek into the day to day lives of people we admire from afar

And we come back with the feeling of being acquainted to the stranger we have never met  
Or might never meet.

First off – the book is massive

A whopping 29 hours \[19 hours at 1.5X speed\]  
Yet – I didn’t want this to end. Especially because it was read in Obama’s deep voice that is reassuring.

Obama takes us on a journey through his childhood to his political infancy, through grassroots activism and his explosive growth to the highest office in America.

It has details – a lot of it, both personal and political. More of the latter than the former though.

It covers his compelling journey of turning his political aspirations into reality – amidst personal and political battles that seemed insurmountable

It was mesmerizing to understand the underlying diplomacy and mind- games that entails moving to the highest office

Reflecting on his presidency, he delves into landmark moments that marked his first term of presidency – It’s now an account of American history, a record of his decisions and time in office

Taking over the presidency at a tumultuous time – with the fall of Lehman brothers and with the economy in turmoil  
To passing the controversial Affordable care act  
Tackling international issues whilst reflecting on the role and responsibility that US plays in mediating across countries beyond its borders – from the war torn middle-east, to the delicate balance of power across countries that need to be maintained to bills on climate change

I don’t think I can do justice to the detail by covering this in a few mins.

Three key themes that stood out to me though

1. > ”’Whatever you do won’t be enough,’ I heard their voices say.‘Try anyway.’”  
Politics much like for anyone in power is a game – only the ones who know how to play right win. There are so many instances he calls out where even wanting to do the right thing entails juggling between multiple forces – of negotiation and power plays.  
It reminded me of my naivete I had and maybe still have that ‘if I explain my points cogently and do my work right, things will happen the way I intended it to be’
2. **Emotions drive people**  
And in a trope that is universal specially in people we elect. People vote for stories – Not rational decisions or a cost benefit analysis. And in the absence of rationality or to mask it – hot button topics are used universally for diverting attention. It is always a story of us vs them. Defined by race, gender, nationality or religion That is the common denominator that can be always relied upon to drive divisiveness. And the critical role media plays in shaping narratives. And the only thing that can hold us through is awareness, learning and education.
3. **The backstory. There is always a backstory.** The international diplomacy fascinated me. We are made privy to his thoughts as he takes critical decisions – of sending young soldiers knowing many won’t return. I have always wondered the thoughts of leaders who meet and pose for smiling photographs – something I loved reading about.

He talks about people, puts us in places and situations we have only read the headlines for. From the situation room where he planned and waited in baited breath for the fall of Osama Bin Laden, to places around the world – from Moscow to Beijing.  
Across Sarah Palin to Vladamir Putin, Manmohan Singh to Gen Stanley MacChrystal  
And finally, though lesser than what I anticipated it would be – glimpses of his life with Michelle and the girls. Of losing out of being a ‘unknown person’ and a ‘normal life’ on the street forever.

After being surprised that this book covered only his first term of presidency I realized late that there is apparently an second volume that is due. One I can’t wait to get my hands on.

Such a beautifully written book – while I do not have enough context of the country to comment about the decisions taken or his leadership, it is a powerful narrative of what an individual can achieve.

I will end this with my favorite quote – one I have on a post-it at my desk

> “Enthusiasm makes up for a host of deficiencies.”
