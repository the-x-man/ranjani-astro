‘Can we build moral machines’?

In an experiment, Alan Winfield showed “how a blue robot saved a red robot from walking into a “danger zone” by (gently) colliding with it.

In another, two red robots were heading for danger zones and the blue robot can only save one—an ethical dilemma that endearingly caused it to dither between the two.

The robot behaves ethically not because it chooses to but because it’s programmed to do so,” Winfield said.

“We call it an ethical zombie.”

In this brilliant interview he talks about whether we can create artificially conscious machines and what does it imply if/when we do?

The dystopian science fiction story, “Klara and the Sun”, by Kazuo Ishigaro, told the story of Klara, a solar-powered AF (Artificial Friend), who is chosen by Josie, a sickly child, to be her companion.

The ending shows the AF left out in a Wall-E reminiscent environment to fend for itself until it runs out.

It begs the question, if we build machines that are conscious, can they suffer from our actions?

Or if they even do, are we even going to be aware of them.

Give this a read.
