5 tips to manage your time as a working parent

How do you manage time is one of the top questions I get.

Especially from working mothers.

My time isnâ€™t mine alone.

You can have a well planned calendar and the kid can throw a fit. There are always things to do, classes to get to or groceries to buy

Here are 5 things I have learnt the hard way that can help

**1) Build your personal schedule and routine. Then one for the family.**

Schedule in every single thing that requires your inputs. I do a running 2 month calendar that is updated weekly along with the family.

**2) Align on outcomes not tasks**

Work out segregation in terms of outcomes with the family â€“ one parent manages everything regarding say, play dates

**3) Agree on boundaries**

Nothing annoys me like context switching â€“ especially when I am in the middle of a pomodoro. Agree on time slots when individuals are unavailable and when they would spend time together.

**4) Seek Help**

Define your dealbreakers. Seek help with everything else.

I am not ok with not having time to read to the kid each day.

I am ok with not being the mother with the best baked cake at school.

**5) Plan to fail**

Things will not go as per plan. So account time for things to fail. Which it will ðŸ™‚

Finally, make it fun. We try to gamify the entire thing. There is no one harder in the world to convince than a soon to be 7 year old.

How do you manage your energy and time?
