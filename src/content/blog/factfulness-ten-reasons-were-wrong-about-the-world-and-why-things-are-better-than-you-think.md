Have you watched the movie 2012?

I recall turning to my husband and asking him, “So are we saying that in a country with a billion plus population – not one could afford to get onto the ark?

And more importantly, all we are doing is praying to the gods waiting for the waves to wash us away?” 🙂

My current read, Factfulness, addresses a critical space – with data.

About how our world has (and continues to become) a much better place over time.

He makes a strong case for The Myth of Us vs Them

Around Why the “Developed and Developing world” distinction no longer works

And the tropes that media feeds us is probably 30 years old. It is beyond everything else – lazy.

“Of all the myths spread by the media, perhaps none is more detrimental than Us vs Them: the idea that the world is divided into two groups – good and the evil”

Or the developed vs the developing.

Whereas, in fact, the gap is where the majority lies.

“In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens.

They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective—from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse)”

“There’s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.”

Highly recommend!
