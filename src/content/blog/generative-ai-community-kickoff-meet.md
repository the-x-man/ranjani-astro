Our very first Generative AI Community kick-off session at [nasscom](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is here!

Thanks to [Ramkumar Narayanan](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Atul Batra](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) who continue to lead from the front and foster a sense of community â€“ last evening brought in founders, industry experts, VCs and startups to engage in dialogue and network in this exciting space.

The Generative AI space has been touted to be the â€˜mosiac momentâ€™ and the energy and passion was evident in the room.

Loved [Dr. Rohini Srivathsa](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)â€˜s kick-off on the topic â€“ enlightening and sparked a lot of conversations.

Thanks to all those who braved Bangalore traffic to make it and to [Kritika M](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and her team for being such generous hosts!

Personally, I was so honored to get to meet the (very humble) Rajendra Singh Pawar â€“ founder of NIIT and Padma Bhushan awardee.

And meeting some of my most favorite people â€“ [Ramkumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), [P Ramani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [Pankaj](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) ðŸ™‚

Here is more to come! And I canâ€™t wait to host another community event in this space!â€™

If you are building in **#GenerativeAI**, I would love to learn more. Please DM
