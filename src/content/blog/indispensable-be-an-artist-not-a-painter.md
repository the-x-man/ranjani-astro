How can one differentiate oneself in Career and in life, I was asked, on a podcast I was recently on.

Seth Godin answered this best in one of my favorite books called Linchpin, that I highly recommend.

There is a village in China – Outside of Shenzen called Dafen.

It is said that 60% of new oil paintings worldwide was produced here. The workers in Dafen – while diligent and talented aren’t artists – they are painters.

Cogs in a painting machine.

Seth talks about 2 paintings he owns from Dafen for 60 USD each. Who knows which Dafen resident painted them – no one.

Who cares – no one. The painters are replaceable.

This is becoming more essential in order to survive in the workplace because the days of being a cog in the wheel are over both for ourselves and the teams we lead.

The job is what you do when you are told what to do – it is following instructions and meeting specifications.

Someone can always do it better and cheaper.

Your art is what you do when no one can tell you exactly how to do it? Do you go above your job description to connect the dots by taking responsibility?

Are you challenging the status quo and making things better.

Be an artist not a painter
