Today my team has a No-meeting-Day  
And this is why that is important  
  
Deep-work and intensive problem solving needs time to think  
And DO.  
  
Having people collaborating across geographies in a remote first set up can get hard  
  
Productivity suffers if people are constantly interrupted.  
  
Create time to get stuff done.  
If you cannot do a no-meeting day, you can do blocks of time each day where meetings are banned.  
  
Give your teams time to make things â€“ And make it part of your culture
