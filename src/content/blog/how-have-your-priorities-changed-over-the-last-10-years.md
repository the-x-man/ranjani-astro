How have your priorities changed over the last 10 years?

We overestimate what we can do in a day and

Underestimate what we can do over a year

When I started my first job with [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) nearly 15 years ago, my focus was, unabashedly, the financial freedom it offered.

Down the line, I went through the rabbit hole of ‘how do I grow in my career’ and ‘am I learning?’

Over the last couple of years, the flexibility of time, learning and leveraging tech for good are bigger motivators

Whilst a part of the world is moving rapidly with exponentially growing tech, there is another – who is playing catch up.

Tech to me is the greatest leveller.

You never know whom you can reach or impact – in your own tiny way.

And thus, it is gratitude notes such as these that make it so fulfilling to write on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

How have you transformed over the last decade?
