Hi All!

Here is your weekly dose of “5 Point Saturdays,” – interesting tidbits from what I have been Reading: Latest reviews, Books, Weekly challenges, Learning Hacks, and More!

##### What am I reading

[The Future of Humanity](https://ranjanimani.com/?nltr=NjsxO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5pbi9GdXR1cmUtSHVtYW5pdHktVGVycmFmb3JtaW5nLUludGVyc3RlbGxhci1JbW1vcnRhbGl0eS9kcC8wMTQxOTg2MDY5L3JlZj1zcl8xXzE%2FZGNoaWxkPTEma2V5d29yZHM9RnV0dXJlK29mK2h1bWFuaXR5JnFpZD0xNTk5OTAyNTg0JnNyPTgtMTs7MzQ1MTFkZTM4ZTJjMTM4MjQxY2I0Y2E5ZGJlZDQ3ODE%3D): Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond

[The Progress Principle](https://ranjanimani.com/?nltr=NjsxO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5pbi9Qcm9ncmVzcy1QcmluY2lwbGUtQW1hYmlsZS9kcC8xNDIyMTk4NTdYL3JlZj1zcl8xXzE%2FZGNoaWxkPTEma2V5d29yZHM9VGhlK1Byb2dyZXNzK1ByaW5jaXBsZSZxaWQ9MTU5OTkwMjczMiZzcj04LTE7O2U0ZWE1OWJjYWM1NGZiYTlkMDBlYTE2MDFhYjFlMmM5) – Using Small Wins to ignite joy, engagement and creativity at work

##### What did I learn this week

I completed an online course on [Leading Innovation from Stanford](https://ranjanimani.com/?nltr=NjsxO2h0dHBzOi8vb25saW5lLnN0YW5mb3JkLmVkdS9jb3Vyc2VzL3hpbmUyMjktbGVhZGluZy1pbm5vdmF0aW9uOztlMmEwYTM2MmMwYzk5ZDk3YjY3NDE3ZTYwNzI0NDkwMQ%3D%3D) that highlighted how leaders could differentiate between routine and innovative work and foster a creative environment. Professor Robert Sutton used this 7 min clip from [IDEO](https://ranjanimani.com/?nltr=NjsxO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkZW8uY29tLzs7MmE0MDU4NjhmMjdlYjRkNTgwOWQyNWMyZDg4N2U0YWI%3D) \[the global design and innovation company\] to highlight the idea generation process

##### Funniest thing I watched this week

[UPS Commercial “Consultants”](https://ranjanimani.com/?nltr=NjsxO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9UDdNN0EzNGI2Unc7OzI4MGRiOTNhMDUyZTg5MTkwMWIzYjk0MzMxNzhlYjYy)

Reminded me of the knowing-doing gap. Also, about how innovation without implementation does not drive results

##### Video that I am loving!

Have you ever wondered what motivates us? Research showed that for non-menial tasks, more money, counter intuitively, produced worse results

[RSA ANIMATE: Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates us](https://ranjanimani.com/?nltr=NjsxO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9dTZYQVBudUZqSmM7O2YwNDAxODY4YzkyOGY0NDA4NjJhMmM2MzNiMDZjYzBh)

##### Quote that I am pondering over

> “You fight as if you are right, you listen as if you are wrong”
