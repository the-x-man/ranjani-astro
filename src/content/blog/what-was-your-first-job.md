What was your first job?

  
The first couple of roles we play have an inordinate amount of influence on our careers.

To how we work, what we end up doing and the leaders we then become (or don’t want to become:)) 

And that, therefore, should be an intentional choice to make.

  
I loved [Deborah Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) recent post on her first job in a fast food restaurant and her learnings around how the hardest of jobs are undervalued.

  
That is an area we could improve upon – we frown down upon letting our kids take up service jobs before starting their careers since they can be hugely character building activities.

  
In my last year of Electronics Engineering, much like most others, I got placed in TCS. 

As fate would have it, they pushed out the joining date by 4 months. Uncertainty isn’t something I am comfortable with and I went on an interviewing spree – landing 3 offers out of college, finally choosing to join the [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) India Development team

  
This photo popped up this morning, from our first year at work 

It shows part of our batch of engineers – fresh-faced and eager to prove ourselves to the world. 

(and yet my first thought was – ‘Oh, I was quite chubby:))

  
Of all the exciting firsts I recall from my time there, a couple stand out.

– Thanks to my technical lead, to this day, I cannot stand a poorly commented piece of code.

– And thanks to my first boss, a value that I hold dearly is ‘Be respectful, Be nice’.

  
What was your first job? And what do you still carry from there?
