Ask better questions

“How do I get into analytics?” “What should I do next?”

I get a lot of such questions during my mentoring sessions.

Unless one knows you personally, these are questions that don’t yield much value.

These are what Reid Hoffman called ‘Blue Sky questions’.

“What are the skills you gauge in business analysts you hire fresh out of college”

” I am in project management and switching to product – these are the risks that I see that I am working towards – what else would you recommend I should be looking into?”

They are specific. They are areas a mentor can add value. They show you have done your homework and separate you from the rest.

Learning to ask better questions. It’s a skill that pays off across your career.

Do you have other under rated skills that you recommend?
