Learning to Negotiate is what I call PIVOT skills.

It is one of those high ROI skills that helps you tremendously

Both in your career and in your life

Here are Six Guidelines for “Getting to Yes”

**#1**. Separate the people from the problem.

**#2**. Focus on interests, not positions.

**#3**. Learn to manage emotions.

**#4**. Express appreciation.

**#5**. Put a positive spin on your message.

**#6**. Escape the cycle of action and reaction.

The one I have found the most useful is **#1**

It is easy to forget that our counterparts have feelings, opinions, values, and unique backgrounds that contribute to what they do and say during talks.

For example, if you’re having problems with a generator breaking down repeatedly, don’t say: “Your company makes shoddy equipment,” or “Your service people don’t know what they’re doing.”

Instead, point out: “This is the third time this month that it’s broken down, and disrupted our business. What can we do to improve its reliability? Should we contact another company for a second opinion?”
