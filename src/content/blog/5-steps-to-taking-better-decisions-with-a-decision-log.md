What I learned from 4 months of maintaining a Decision Log?

I maintained a log of all decisions I have taken, the reasons why and how they turned out.

And this is one thing I have learnt

That the decisions that tend to not do exceptionally well are the ones that start with requiring massive changes – in people, process or tech.

While starting with a big bang could be good for enthusiasm, rallying troops towards a common vision and course correct work better with tiny improvements iterated over and over.

Awareness is critical.

If you are looking at improving your decisions, here are 5 ideas to get started

**#1** Start with keeping a log of decisions you take, why and how they have turned out. Identify your actions that caused poor and good decisions.

**#2** Seek feedback from people you work with around things that you should start-stop and continue. For example – I realise I tended to often skip the small talk and get to task solving unless I am conscious about it.

**#3** Identify problem use-cases around areas you want to improve on and talk out aloud/write down scenarios of how you would tackle it. Example – How should you handle working with ambiguity with specific examples.

**#4** Record yourself introducing yourself or explaining something to another person and listen to it. I realise I tend to not just talk fast but also communicate too many things within a single conversation. Something that doesn’t make for impact.

**#5** Talk to people – Learning from people is something I have oft-ignored in lieu of books. This is absolutely game-changing.

Do you have ideas or tips around how you have actively worked on improving decisions?
