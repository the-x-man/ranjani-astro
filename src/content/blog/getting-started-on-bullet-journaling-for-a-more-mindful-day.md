Being in control over your time is the ultimate freedom.

There are always more things to do than the time one has.

After trying out multiple apps and productivity tools, the one that I have found works the best for me is a plain old journal and a pen

I use what is called ‘Bullet Journaling” to not just be organized but to also get to what Scott Adams calls ‘Systems’ as opposed to Goals.

Most of our thoughts are around things we missed doing, should be doing or plan to be doing.

Putting them down on paper frees up one’s resources to do better stuff that matters!

I took out an hour yesterday to set up the bullet journal for H2 of 2021.

Here are the 7 key things I use it to track

**#DailyLog**

**#MonthlyLog**

**#FutureLog**

**#HabitTracker**

**#Thoughts**

**#Books**

**#Systems** for personal goals

Do you use a mindfulness/productivity tool that helps you plan your day?
