Have you heard the story of the guy who traded a paper clip to a house?

Kyle MacDonald did exactly that

He traded up from one red paperclip to a house, in only a year through 14 trades!

It’s an unlikely and amazing journey with lots of surprises along the way documented in his blog nearly 15 years ago.

I was reading Stanford’s D.School’s Tina Seelig highlight this example for creating value in her ‘Entrepreneurship and Innovation’ course where we she highlighted this example.

Such a brilliant illustration of how to leverage opportunities, use creativity and being entrepreneurial – in all that you do
