Day 6 – #30daysofWeb3 Learning Challenge

Who will control the software that powers the internet with Web 3.0?

Can decentralisation move the narrative from ‘Don’t be evil’ to ‘Can’t be evil’?

###### **5 key take-aways** 

_Sources below_

#1 Over the 35 years lifespan of the internet, control gradually shifted from the open-source protocols to proprietary services driven by tech companies. This unleashed huge benefits for end users with amazing tech. Albeit, it brought with it concerns around privacy and user control

#2 The growing movement with Blockchain, the author points out, combines the power of centralized services with the community ethos

#3 Could this mean the pendulum could swing back to an internet governed by open community governed services? Something that has precedence with the Android phones running open sourced Linux

#4 “A core insight in the design of blockchains is that the open source model can be extended beyond software to cloud-based services by adding financial incentives to the mix” – something that can be enabled with tokens

#5 What does it mean for the future?

“The emerging technology of crypto and web3 — specifically, programmable blockchains, composable smart contracts, and digital assets — makes it possible for decentralized systems to achieve unprecedented levels of coordination and operational functionality.

This evolution enables new forms of governance and organizations, community-owned-and-operated networks and services, robust economies, and countless other innovations.”

In the next edition, we can dive deeper into the various principles of decentralization
