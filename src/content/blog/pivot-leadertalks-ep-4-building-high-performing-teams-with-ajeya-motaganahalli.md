What do you do when people you manage fail?

1) You forgive and forget

2) You remember, pass blame, stigmatise and humiliate them

3) You forgive and remember

The right approach that Bob Sutton, a Professor of Management at Stanford University advocates is to

– forgive so that people have psychological safety and

– remember, so that you can learn, the person can learn and the organisation can learn

There can be no innovation or learning without failure.

‘Failure sucks but Instructs’

The first thing that struck me when I spoke to [Ajeya Motaganahalli](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) was his sense of focus on setting up a culture and process that drives performance vs a purely results oriented mindset.

The leaders who you have loved working with have mostly been the one’s who had your back.

And [Ajeya Motaganahalli](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) comes across as exactly that – a leader one wants to work for. One I would always look up to.

Join us tomorrow in **#Episode4** of PIVOT **#LeaderTalks** to deconstruct how you set up and scale high performing teams. And how you can set up a culture devoid of fear.

PIVOT **#Leadertalks** works towards my personal goal to help Scale Women in AI and Product Leadership.
