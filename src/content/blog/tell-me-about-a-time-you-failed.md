‘Ajay had expanded upon his charter to take up a new area.

The new team was still in its formation and there were a number of challenges he could immediately see.

Including lack of processes and clear scope. He worked with his teams to identify the gaps and requirements. He knew what would work based on his previous experience and put together a proposal.

When he enthusiastically presented it to the management in the next MBR, he was met with… silence.

What do you think happened there?

An area we fail to think when solving problems is this –

” Does everyone have the same view of the problem as I do”

Action bias is good. But when we jump into solutioning before we are clear ourselves/peers about the problem statement, we are likely to be setting ourselves up for failure.

So what could have Ajay done differently?

Maybe talk to his Data Engineering and Product counterparts to understand their perspectives

And built allies and alignment for his proposal before presenting to the leadership.”

This isn’t the story of Ajay, but something I have seen this narrative play out multiple times across workplaces

Tell me about a time when you failed at your workplace? And what were your learnings from that?
