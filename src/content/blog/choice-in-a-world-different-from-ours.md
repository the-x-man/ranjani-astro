**#spoileralert**

In a world far into a future – say we are faced with these 4 hypothetical questions. What will you choose to do?

**#1If** you could choose to not see or feel physical beauty for a more equal world, would you choose to do so?

**#2What** if you could increase your intelligence to super human levels – where would you stop. And what would you do to mankind with your gift of super intelligence?

**#3Is** time an illusion. What if alien life comprehended language and time differently from us? Does spoken and written language have to match – or be linear?

**#4What** if the very fundamentals you base your life on is shaken and proved wrong?

Ted Chiang is undoubtedly one of the most deeply intelligent sci-fi authors you can read.

This eight ‘short stories’ including the title that served as the basis for the movie “Arrival.” are beyond sc–fi. They are speculative questions of a world ours could be. An unbeatable combination of nerd appeal and philosophy.

Here are 4 of the ones I absolutely enjoyed – along with fundamentals they question.

**#Story1** “Understand:”

What if you could increase your intelligence to super human levels – where would you stop. And what would you do to mankind with your gift of super intelligence?

“A man who suffered severe brain damage due to a fall through thin ice, is put on an experimental medicine that begins to stimulate neurogenesis on a massive scale. The protagonist becomes preternaturally intelligent, realizes that such super-intelligence is considered a threat, but is able to keep one step ahead of the ordinary minds who pursue him. That is until he runs into another patient who had a similar accident and treatment”

**#Story2** “Division by Zero:”

What if the very fundamentals you base your life on is shaken and proved wrong?

“If a scholar’s life was invested in an idea or way of thinking about the world, but then the scholar proved that that way was in error, might it cause a descent into madness and even a crumbling of one’s world?”

**#Story3** “Story of Your Life:”

Is time an illusion. What if alien life comprehending language and time different from ours? Does spoken and written language have to match – or be linear?

“This is the story that the Amy Adams’ movie “Arrival” is based upon. The protagonist is a linguist charged with helping to communicate with a newly arrived alien species that has a very different approach to language. In the process of learning their language and interacting with them, she begins to see the world as they do – time being an illusion”

**#Story4** “Liking What You See: A Documentary:”

If you could choose to not see or feel physical beauty, would you adopt that?

“This imagines a technology that prevents wearers from being able to recognized beauty (and ugliness as well.) As the subtitle suggests, it’s presented as if it were a documentary that is following a college’s debate over whether to require the student body to use said technology”

Sci-fi is hands-down my favorite genre.
