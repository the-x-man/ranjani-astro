Top Technology Trends 2022 – **#1** Generative AI

“By 2025, generative AI will account for 10% of all data produced, from less than 1% today”

1) WHAT : Generative AI refers to “programs that can use existing content like text, audio files, or images to create new plausible content”. In layman terms, it enables computers to learn the underlying pattern related to the input, and then use that to generate similar (artificial) content/data.

2) APPLICATIONS? Applications include the much touted/controversial ‘Deepfakes”. It produces real looking photos, image-to-image conversions (B/W to color, photo to paintings…), Film restoration, Ageing… “Generative AI can be used for a range of activities such as creating software code, facilitating drug development and targeted marketing”

3) HOW: There are various techniques to do that such as generative adversarial networks (GANS), transformers, and variational autoencoders

4) CONCERNS: It could be “misused for scams, fraud, political disinformation, forged identities and more”

5) HOW IS IT USED TODAY? Gartner calls out the use-case where ” the UK financial conduct authority has used generative AI to create synthetic payment data by abstracting information from 5 M records of real payment data. This synthetic data set will be used to create new fraud models without revealing individual data

Generative AI is part of Gartner’s 2022 tech trends.
