“For twenty years, the company ran mentorship programs, identified and promoted talented women early and often, and offered numerous trainings. And yet the only women in the C-suite were in marketing and HR, both pivotal but non-P&L roles. Why? “

\*\*A new study of 21 female CEOs by Korn Ferry. Experts say that the systemic change necessary to consistently feed C-suites with diverse candidates has not yet happened.

\*\*At most companies, future CEOs need to be in sequenced global rotations across P&L leadership and key enterprise roles starting 10 to 15 years before they enter the C-suite. These key roles, especially broad general-management jobs, are often skipped over—leading to the “superstar capabilities but lacking experienced candidates” problem.

There are a lot of things in this article that struck me

– How we tend to focus on getting women back to work but little on building and sustaining a pipeline to leadership : key being that executive roles require a pipeline starting 10-15 years before they move into C suite

– What also struck me is the research around fewer women wanting to be leaders. I wonder how much of this is driven by our societal norms. While I personally have been hugely ambitious – I have had the support and backing of my family. I wonder if it might have been different if that was at odds.

What do you think holds women back from leadership positions, especially in P&L roles?
