What NOT to say in an email?

[LinkedIn News](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) recently had an post about passive aggressive phrases to avoid in emails. Do you use any of these?

â€“ Per last email

â€“ For Future reference

â€“ Bumping this to the top of your inboxâ€¦

â€“ Just to be sure we are on the same pageâ€¦

â€“ Going forwardâ€¦..

Here are a couple of additional tips for you to manage your emails (rather than the other way around)

**#1** â€˜Be nice, be respectfulâ€™ â€“ If it isnâ€™t something you wouldnâ€™t say to them physically, donâ€™t write it in an email â€“ assume all emails get read.

**#2** â€˜Assume positive intentâ€™: Do not misinterpret an innocuous status question into â€˜am I not collaboratingâ€™. Start with assumed goodwill. This applies to life too.

**#3** Write fewer emails : The elephant in the room â€“ the quantum of emails! In his book, Indistractable, [Nir Eyal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) calls out that on an average people get 100 mails/day. That could translate to more than half a productive work-day feeding our elephant brain of seemingly â€˜doing workâ€™.

So as he recommends, timebox your time with emails.

If possible have notifications off â€“ I block my first half for critical work + reading and second for emails + meetings.

I also have a â€˜Amma is busy at workâ€™ post-it on my door, which oft gets overlooked. But well, one can only but try ðŸ™‚

Any other tips for effective communication at work?
