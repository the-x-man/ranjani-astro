AI isn’t 42\. It isn’t the answer to everything.

‘Can we use AI to…..’? is something one hears oft.

We’ll use AI to solve it, say startups, to gnarly problems

A human centric approach to designing AI starts, rightly so, with the user problem in focus’

‘How can we solve for x?’

‘Can AI solve for this problem in a unique way?’

Maybe we need AI, maybe we don’t. We don’t need to build a churn model – we need to figure out how to reduce churn.

Maybe AI is used to automate or augment intelligence. But that AI is a tool. Not the solution.

Designing Human-Centered AI Products starts with the user. Not the tool.
