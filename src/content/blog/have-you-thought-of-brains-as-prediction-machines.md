Have you thought of brains as prediction machines?

Imagine you walk into your room one day and find that your laptop is looking smaller than usual.

Or that the stapler makes a different sound when being used

Would you notice?

Of course, we would.

We notice these changes even if we are not attending to these objects You don’t need to ask yourself if the stapler is the correct length. Changes to the normal just pop into your head. And your attention will be drawn to them by your brain. Almost instantly.

There is only one explanation, Jeff Dawkins’ says that is possible.

“My brain, specifically my neocortex, was making multiple simultaneous predictions of what you were about to see, hear or touch”

Every time I moved my eyes, it predicted the smallest gestures such as the texture of the coffee cup or the larger ones like the month you should expect to see on your computer.

You were not born knowing how a stapler sounds.

Prediction was the ubiquitous function of the neocortex. Predictions of the model of the world it expects. Constantly.

Neocortex constantly learns the model of the world and it makes predictions on what it expects across sensory modalities.

Does learning about the ultimate prediction machine help us design a better future with AI?
