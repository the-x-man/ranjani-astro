What is the best career advice you have got?

Schooling optimises for who knows and communicates the most.

And as someone who topped classes, that is what I learnt to do

I transitioned the mindset when I moved into my career – I had this inherent need to let people know all that I was doing.

When I was chatting with one of my mentors who was an SVP at the time, I asked him, ‘What is it that he did differently as he scaled up?’

Amongst other things, what he mentioned was exactly this – ‘Learning to communicate at the right altitude with the message tailored to the person’

The more removed the person is from you in terms of levels, the lesser they share context with you.

Translating your message into what it means to them ensures it lands at the right level.

Since that conversation, I oft reflect on how I do this myself and how I can now perceive it in conversations I have with others.

“I remember sitting in on an executive review where a Product Manager was talking about the recent launch of a major product.

As someone who worked far away from their team, I had a really hard time parsing what they were trying to say. I walked away confused and frustrated, because it was not clear to me who the product was for, or why we were working on it

Often, the difference between a good leader and a great one is altitude. Being able to navigate at the right level for the conversation, whether you’re doing a deep dive into the details with a colleague or discussing high-level strategy with executives, is a rare skill.

But it is also crucial to hone in order to be successful in the workplace”, says [Deborah Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) in her article linked below.

Are you ensuring your message lands at the right level with your audience?

Honing on that skill is worth its weight in gold
