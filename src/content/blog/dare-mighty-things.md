“Dare Mighty Things” was the hidden message on NASA’s Mars rover parachute.  
  
It was a phrase used first by Theodore Roosevelt, the 26 President of United States.  
  
It also is a mantra at Jet Propulsion Lab  
  
Systems engineer Ian Clark at JPL used a binary code to spell out “Dare Mighty Things” in the orange and white strips of the 70-foot (21-meter) parachute.  
  
Clark, a crossword hobbyist, came up with the idea two years ago when the Engineers wanted an unusual pattern in the nylon fabric to know how the parachute was oriented during descent.  
  
Once they put out a teaser about the cryptic encoded message, it took a few hours for the internet fans to figure it out.

How fantastic is that message?
