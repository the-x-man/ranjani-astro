NASSCOM :

Under nasscom’s Future of work initiative, we had organised a webinar on Generative AI: Implications on Work and Workforce.  
  
The stellar panel comprising thought leaders from [Atlassian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atlassian/), [Deloitte](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deloitte/), [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/) and [Tech Mahindra](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tech-mahindra/) took us through the realities of Generative AI and what this means for the future of work. Here are a few key takeaways:  
  
– Important to understand what Generative AI is/isn’t; what it can/can’t do  
– Important to identify the problem to be solved and then apply the technology  
– Most enterprises are exploring how they could apply Gen AI to their business  
– Emerging areas: Enterprise search, analytics, dashboarding, recommendation systems  
– High impact verticals: Sports, Media & Entertainment, Healthcare  
– Generating new business: Marketplace for Prompts  
– Rapid skilling is priority: The need to be intelligent to be productive; Master self-learning  
– One big ask for India’s academia is to focus on ensuring that the talent pool has their fundamentals in place esp. in the fields of Mathematics, Probability and Statistics  
– India can be a great test bed for Generative AI  
– An important concern highlighted was: How do we know what is real vs. AI generated? Need to have guardrails in place
