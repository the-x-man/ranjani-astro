What if ‘Humankind is given a Universal Basic Income’?

The thought was partly triggered because I had just read Daniel Susskind’s ‘A World Without Work’

And because I love futuristic technology and I wonder about things like why we work beyond it being a means of sustenance

And about how our jobs are so tied to our identities today

And what happens if/when at a point in future, that becomes optional to work

Would we still pursue vocations? What are the areas where we will still like to retain humans vs AI

What would you choose to do in a world without work?
