What would I recommend to my 20 year old self?

Someone I mentor asked me this recently.

Counter-intuitive as it sounds, I would say invest in holistic personality development vs. only stellar academic credentials.

Being the nerd that I was, I spent every spare minute poring over books, fighting with professors over the 2 marks lost, skipping anything that didn’t come with credits and sticking to others of my kind.

While I could have put myself out there, networked with people different from myself \[who, by the way, turned out super successful\], learnt to see things from their perspective, asked why more often, picked a hobby or a sport and most importantly, chilled out a bit.

Yes – good academics matters.

In real world though, outcomes matter more than outputs.

And that is learnt beyond the pages of a book.

What is your advice to your 20 year old self?
