I took up this course called Semiotics during my post graduation.

If the subject was a person, we’d stand on two extreme ends of a football field, for the left-brained person I was.

I remember the professor showing us an image of a pipe, titled “Ceci n’est pas une pipe”

French for “This is not a pipe.”

I recalled this incident when I came across Shawn Achor’s ‘Science of Happiness’

The core message is simple – “It’s not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality”

The usual assumption is that our external world is a predictor of our happiness, “when in reality, if I know everything about your external world, I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness.

90% of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world”.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* So how do we get the Happiness Advantage?\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Work harder – Be happy and successful is what we are taught.

In fact our brains work in the opposite order.

“If you can raise somebody’s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.

 In fact, we’ve found that every single business outcome improves. Your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed “

So how do you get the Happiness Advantage?
