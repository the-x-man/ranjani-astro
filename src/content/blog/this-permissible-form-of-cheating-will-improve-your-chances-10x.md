I have been trying this new hack out after I read Canadian Astronaut, Chris Hadfield, talk about how they use this in space training

And it works.

Gearing up for a huge presentation, interview or game? – Doing this one thing will definitely improve your chances.

What is it?

Preparation prior to the event using simulations of various possible scenarios and outcomes.

#1Simulate the Worst-Case and all potential scenarios

#2Visualize and Prepare for Failure

You can learn as much as possible from simulations, and how astronauts prepare.

There is no snake oil here – just sheer hard \[and smart work\] to success.

Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.
