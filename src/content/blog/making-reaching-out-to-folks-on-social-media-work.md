Why do folks not respond to cold DMs?

Cold DM 101

You want to reach out to someone you don’t know. Maybe you seek a referral, mentoring or want to learn more about their journey.

You type Hi and wait for a response.

And get radio silence.

Lets deconstruct how you can engage better with folks on social media

1) Say what you or want or seek : We treat inboxes like visits to a stranger’s house – akin to knocking on the door and waiting for a response. It doesn’t work that way.

Unless you know the person, rarely will a stranger response to random Hi messages.

Provide a short intro and ask what you seek along with why.

2) Engage with the person : A person accepted your invite and you immediately bombard them with a sales pitch. This must be Sales 101 – I can’t think of one reason when this will result in a conversion. Seek to engage with the person or their posts first.

3) Apply Second Order Thinking : Ask yourself – ‘“And then what?”

“Can you help me?” questions sans context are not helpful – especially from a stranger. Please do your homework – ask specific questions.

Connecting with people on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and learning from them is the biggest joy and reason I write here daily.

I have met some wonderful folks here – doing just that – with cold DMs. Make them work for you 🙂

Any tips that worked for you?
