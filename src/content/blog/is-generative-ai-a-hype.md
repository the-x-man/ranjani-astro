Is Generative AI a hype?

That is a question I get. A lot.

To some extent there is always going to be some hype around new tech.

But largely, I believe, there is humongous value that will be created by Generative AI.

It is like an report called out – an Generational change

Or like I call out in my podcast – An iPhone Moment

McKinsey research pegs that at $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion of value annually.

Which then begs the question – how do we look at adopting and getting value from this?

I come across a lot of fluffy articles around the topic.

But I quite like this one from McKinsey

The research in the below link calls out the 9 actions that CIOs and CTOs can take to reimagine business and technology with generative AI.

Also, have a look at the Gen AI tech stack – highly recommend a read if this is an area that you are even tangentially interested in
