###### What is Critical Thinking?

By definition – ‘The objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgement’ is termed as Critical thinking.

###### Why be a critical thinker?

Being a critical thinker sets you apart from the crowd instantly – it allows you to be a more perceptive and logical thinker without falling into the trap of your learnt personal biases.

For example, if you could stop to review the confrontation with your loved ones or in deciding whether you want to pick the new diet plan that promises washboard abs. It could be in deciding the strategy on the way ahead for the product you manage at work or in analyzing how your team could contribute to the overall sales target. It could also be in questioning your current beliefs and debunking principles you have followed sans reasons.

In this video, Samantha Agoos explains a simple system for approaching any problem or tough decision in your life.

###### Step 1 – Formulate your question

Know what you are looking for.

For example, if you deciding whether to try out the newest diet craze that shows results in 2 weeks pause to ask yourself – What are you trying to accomplish by dieting?  
Weight Loss, Better nutrition or More energy? Your reasons may be obscured by other factors such as seeing results in 2 weeks. Thinking critically will help you sift through the information to see if the fad really suits your needs.

###### Step 2 – Gather your information

There is an overwhelming amount of information around. Having the right question will help you get to the relevant information. Get more information about the problem or decision at hand. Ask an expert or seek testimony from those who have experienced it. This helps weigh different options before you pick one.

###### 

###### Step 3 – Apply the information

What does this imply? Ask critical questions when facing a decision. About what concepts are at work and what assumptions exist. Ask yourself if the interpretation of the information is logically sound.  
For example, in an email that promises you millions, consider what is shaping your approach and considering the evidence, if you will win any money at all.

###### Step 4 – Consider the implications

Say you are picking a politician for voting. Even if the immediate promises may seem luring, think of unintended long term consequences. Is that something you are going to be agreeable to?

###### Step 5 – Explore other Point of Views (PoV)

When facing a decision, take a minute to think of the issue from the other person’s perspective. Say, during elections, stop to consider why are so many folks drawn to the opposing POV. Alternatives allow you to get the others’ perspective, evaluate choices and ultimately make better informed decisions.
