Have you seen [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s latest text-to-image generator Imagen?

Its an AI system that creates photorealistic images from input text

As the paper states, ‘ Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation’

‘Human raters strongly prefer Imagen over other methods, in both image-text alignment and image fidelity’

Most importantly, I love how they acknowledge and call out limitations and impact

‘The potential risks of misuse raise concerns regarding responsible open-sourcing of code and demos. At this time we have decided not to release code or a public demo’
