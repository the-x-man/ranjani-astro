When it comes to data, businesses tend to have a ‘capability centric’ vs a ‘user centric’ view

And no one feels the pain more – than the end customer

And the data analyst

“How do I turn data into a ‘sustainable advantage’

How do I create an innovation flywheel for customers, partners and employees

How do I use data as center of a product that I can further monetize”

Those are top of mind items that a data leader in any organization looks at, says Bruno Aziza, Head of Data Analytics at Google

The data can reside in multiple places – a data warehouse, data mart or a data lake.

The legacy systems can hugely hamper agility

Organisations that win look at taking advantage of your existing environment – without the need to change users habits.

**#Can** you govern it intelligently

**#Provide** end users capabilities to do their work

**#Can** you enable multiple use cases through an access and a governance stand point

**#Self** Service capabilities so that people can do their job easily

So how do we do that?

“Monolithic, legacy architectures and centralised data platforms thwart business’ agility, making it difficult to quickly adjust to the constantly changing data landscape that demands new views, new aggregations”

That is where a decentralized data mesh could help

“Both data fabric and data mesh architectures aim to abstract data management complexity and deliver data to the business with agility and scale.”

What does that imply?

“Data fabric is a design concept and architecture geared toward addressing the complexity of data management and minimising disruption to data consumers while ensuring that any data on any platform from any location can be successfully combined, accessed, shared, and governed efficiently and effectively”.

In Simpler words?

Data warehouse, data lake or data mart – > It doesn’t matter

Think of them as nodes in a data fabric that are discoverable, accessible and governed

“Data mesh focuses on organisational change – enabling domain teams to own the delivery of data products with the understanding that the domain teams are closer to their data and thus understand their data better.”

In Plain English?

It enables delivering customised data products linked to business objectives

“Metadata driven Data Fabric” is one of Gartner’s 12 Data and Analytics Trends, 2022

Organisations that win this race are those who look at Data as product.

You don’t enforce capabilities onto users

You start with User Outcomes and build capabilities around it.
