I spent the weekend at a fruit orchard in the rural hinterlands

Reflecting on the experience, on the way back, here are a few perspectives –

1) The world as a ‘we’ know of it – the news we consume, the problems we discuss and trends we cover, is of the bubble we live in – making up maybe 10% of the Tier I – II towns and cities.

The population at large – especially in the rural hinterlands have their own worries – much like Maslow’s hierarchy, focussed on survival.

2) Lack of diversity oft manifests itself as lack of individuality – A large part of the societal fabric is treated as just that – background – scurrying around getting things done to keep the ebb flowing.

I was in a room with an elderly relative who was discussing property rates. Despite me asking pointed questions around it, he continued to respond only to the other male in the room – this, albeit the fact that I earn 10x or manage investments for my family.

Feeling unheard is debilitating. Breaking barriers takes generations.

3) Extreme Wealth disparity – The extreme wealth of folks in the agricultural hinterlands astounds me. More so, because it doesn’t percolate down to the grass roots.

I am genuinely interested in figuring out how to help – if you work in/know of DTC brands in agri-tech, please DM.

A lot of gratitude and a lot of questions from a weekend well spent. Have you had similar experiences?
