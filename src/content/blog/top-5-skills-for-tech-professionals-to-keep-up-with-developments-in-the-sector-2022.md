My top 5 skills for tech professionals to keep up with developments in the sector

“By 2025, 44% of the skills that employees will need to perform their roles effectively will change’, states the WEF Future of Work report.

This morning, I read a [The Verge](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) report on 2023 Tech predictions that called out that “the use of ChatGPT in education will spark a national conversation about AI” – accelerated by the kids spreading this word of mouth.

We tend to think of change linearly whilst tech change happens exponentially.

I obsess over how the world around us changes and how to stay relevant – more for my kid than for myself.

I believe that technology has an intrinsic role to play across professions – making it crucial to have digital literacy – ‘skills that are essential to learn, work and navigate in the digital world’.

Here are my top 5 as we wrap up 2022.

**#1Programming**, Data and AI : These skills are already in high demand and will continue to do so. Even as we worry about AI taking over jobs, there are new ones being created – it is predicted that ’97 million jobs involving artificial intelligence (AI) will be created between 2022 and 2025′. Inspite of the influx of low-code and no code solutions, the need for complementary areas to bring in efficiencies will continue to exist in the near future.

**#2Cloud** Computing : The adoption of cloud computing, big data and e-commerce remain high priorities for business leaders. The demand for Cloud Engineers, DevOps engineers and Cloud Consultants continue to rise. With organizations continuing to move to the cloud globally, skillsets related to cloud technologies will be in demand.

**#3Product** Development and management :

Product management is one of the most sought-after careers in India today. There are over 20,000 product management jobs available for qualified personnel in India.

There is a proliferation of new roles in the area across product owners, analysts and digital product managers

**#4Creator** Economy and Social media management : “As of 2022, the creator economy market size is estimated at $104.2 billion, more than double its value since 2019”. This has spawned the need for low code tools, short form videos, micro-entrepreneurs disrupting traditional roles and new media across organizations.

**#5Digital** transformation, Growth and Digital Marketing : Digital Marketing and Strategy specialists and Digital transformation specialists are some of the top 10 roles that have seen increased demand as corroborated in the WEF report.

What do you think are the most valuable and in-demand skills you think professionals in tech should look at learning to stay relevant?
