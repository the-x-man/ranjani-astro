I have always struggled with taking risks

Risk implies potential failures.

And I hated failing. 

It was very easy to be the child every parent wanted to have – studious, following the rules and being every teachers’ favorite.

But oft, I wondered if that is what I really wanted to do with my life – why I always aspired to live to others’ expectations rather than my own

Of being the ‘model daughter’

And that is why I am in such awe of Sowjanya….

With a 25+ career that has had stints from analytics to sales. She has started over again and again.

Prioritising seeking fulfillment for herself over everything else.

Here is her story –

“We’re all put in moulds. Stop and think about it: What’s your mould made of? Stereotypes, expectations, limitations, obligations and you can fill in the blanks hereon… 

Woman, man, any gender and every identity – we’re force-fitted to a mould. So, who can break your mould? Only you.

That power lies within us.

Say a mental “aye” if you relate.

I’ve had 25+ years of diverse experience in an oh-so-’squiggly’ career. 

Having grown up in a single-parent household with strong female influence, I’ve never had anything come easy. And I have put in the work to try to get what I deserve, at every step.

The epicentre of my evolving experiences has always been learning. 

Through my early years, various jobs, multiple roles, and my very own transformation journey (ongoing, for all of us!) 

And that’s why, with my privileges, I’m at a place that allows me to present ‘attitude makeover’ as a growth facilitator and a mirror of reflection to you.

My journey has taught me it can be transformative to experience discomfort. Even if it feels scary, taking a strategic leap of faith can move you into new realms. 

It revolves around confronting habit with habit, those which will help you evolve. 

Making ‘taking the plunge’ a habit, as a first step almost. My video podcasts are the fruition of the same. 32+ episodes later, I’m enjoying and still discovering my creative self every day. Hence, Attitude Makeover branches out from a very personal place. 

Because, it is about conviction, even for the unconventional. By introspectively looking at one’s facets, consciously recognizing true values, honing the life skills required, and consciously embarking on that career growth journey.

REALIZE. VISUALIZE. ACTUALIZE – That’s our cue to GET, SET, GO!”

Have you taken a risk at your career?

It is my personal goal to help more women overcome the ‘broken rung’ and scale at their careers.
