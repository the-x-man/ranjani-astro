Book Recommendation of the Week : No Rules Rules

Shortlisted for the 2020 Financial Times & McKinsey Business Book of the Year

Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings talks about the unorthodox culture behind one of the world’s most innovative, imaginative, and successful companies.

Here are my top three take-aways –

1. HIGH PERFORMANCE + SELFLESS CANDOR = EXTREMELY HIGH PERFORMANCE – In other words, build talent density, avoid micromanaging and encourage open feedback. Give Freedom, Get Responsibility.
2. 5-A feedback approach – Aim to assist, Actionable, Appreciate, Accept/Decline, Adapt. Say what you really think with good intent. Do not say anything behind a person’s back that you wouldn’t be comfortable sharing with him/her.
3. Are you operating in the ‘creative/knowledge’ economy or a industrial/manufacturing one?  
When a mistake will lead to a disaster, rules and process is essential to have.  
But for those operating in the creative economy – organizations thrive on creativity, agility, freedom and sense of ownership.  
Yet many organizations’ continue to follow processes that dominated the industrial era.
