Crying babies, Women and Work.

I heard such a relatable podcast this morning – sounds ridiculous yet true.

NPR’s PLANET MONEY had this show where first up, a woman tries to buy from female-led companies not just for one breakfast picnic, but for a whole week and struggles through it.

Women-led startups received just 2.3% of venture capital funding in 2020

They spoke about why it is so hard for women to create and retain control of their own companies?

And why maybe, just maybe, this moment we’re in provides a unique opportunity to think about a major economic force standing in the way of millions of women – crying babies.

If you have ever had crying babies, they are a force unto themselves.

The tragedy over the past year and a half is that we have seen millions of women get pushed out of the workforce to go care for those kids because it’s often not possible to do both at the same time – work and child care.

So take a moment to breathe if you are going through this. And if you happen to be at the other side of the table, please be aware and acknowledge it.
