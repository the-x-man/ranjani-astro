At times, straddling with all that I want to do feels like jujitsu

Yet, this was an Executive course that was worth the effort

Berkeley Exec Educations’ 8 week immersive online PM studio is one of those courses that justifies the weekends spent on course work

Here are 5 key areas I took away from this course

– Effectively managing a product team

– Product Management canvas and identifying ‘jobs to be done’

– Centering products around the customer experience

– How to build narrative structures to tell great stories

– Creating value, pricing strategies, negotiation tactics and portfolio planning

Most importantly, I love the cohort based courses with coaches – trying in terms of time, but high value in terms of ROI

For my next learning adventure, I am looking at recommendations. Have one you absolutely loved? Drop a message?
