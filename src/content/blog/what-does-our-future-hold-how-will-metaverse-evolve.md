How do you think the Metaverse will evolve?

Someone had a poll on a superpower to have. It included being able to eat as much as wants or fly or read minds.

I honestly think tech could enable each of those within a century.

More interestingly, the superpower I would love to have is to have a peek into the future decade – much like Marty McFly.

Not so much to change the course but out of sheer curiosity.

An interview called out Satya Nadella’s vision for Metaverse at Microsoft where he said, “Just like the first wave of the internet allowed everybody to build a website, I think the next wave of the internet will be a more open world where people can build their own metaverse worlds, whether they’re organizations or game developers or anyone else.”

‘Even though Meta/Facebook is trying to convince the world that social networking is the most natural on-ramp to the metaverse, it could just as easily be gaming instead’ says the Fast company [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90716389/microsoft-activision-metaverse) on the topic

Do you have resources to recommend on metaverse?
