A Must-Ask Question to make Good Decisions

I had a 1×1 yesterday with a senior leader I quite admire.

We were chatting about decisions – and how one usually has to make them with incomplete information

She mentioned an instance when she had to move roles and was quite torn about picking the right move

Much like most would, she listed out the pros and cons of each.

Her mentor then asked her a simple question that helped her make the choice –

“Are you choosing this to move away from or to move towards something?”

And as you might guess, good results follow decisions when it is precipitated by ‘moving towards something’

Such a simple, yet powerful heuristic.

“In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing”

How do you make decisions?
