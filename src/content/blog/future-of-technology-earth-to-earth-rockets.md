> “In 2017, Musk promised that for the price of an economy airline ticket, his rockets would try you anywhere on earth in under an hour”

**#Futurein5Bullets** **#Rockets** – Earth to Earth

**#Day2**/30

**#FutureofTechnology**

1) Musk plans to use his interplanetary starship for terrestrial passenger delivery

2) The starship travels at 17,500 mph – this means NewYork to Shanghai in 39 minutes. Or London to Dubai in 29 minutes

3) How close to real is this tech? April 2019 marked the first test flights of this rocket. This will erase long-haul flights and be worth £15bn a year by 2030, say experts

4) STARSHIP, SPACEX’S UNDER-CONSTRUCTION GIANT ROCKET, is about to make a big public appearance.

On October 2, CEO Elon Musk confirmed via Twitter the company’s ambitious project, designed to send the first humans to Mars, will release an update “in about three weeks.”

5) Sometime in the next decade or so, “Off to Europe for lunch”, may become a standard part of our lexicon.
