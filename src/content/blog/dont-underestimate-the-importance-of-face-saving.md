“Face-saving” usually carries a derogatory flavor.

People say, “We are doing that just to let them save face,”

The tone implies ridicule.

This is a grave misunderstanding of the role and importance of face-saving. Especially in working with and managing people.

Face-saving reflects a person’s need to reconcile the stand he takes in a negotiation with his principles

When a judge writes an opinion on a court ruling, he is saving face, not only for himself and for the judicial system, but for the parties.

Instead of just telling one party, “You win,” and telling the other, “You lose,” he explains how his decision is consistent with principle, law, and precedent.

Often in a negotiation, people will continue to hold out not because the proposal on the table is inherently unacceptable, but simply because they want to avoid the feeling or the appearance of backing down to the other side.

Bargaining on the problem and not on positions allows the other party to ‘save face’.

As Carnegie says, to communicate effectively, – ‘Let the Other Person Save Face’.

“Consider this the next time you’re faced with finding fault, issuing threats, or criticizing someone in front of others.

A genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude goes a long way towards alleviating the sting!”
