𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗡𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀

Growing up with parents who came from a non-tech background, I oft turned to books for answers to life’s gnarly problems.

And then to mentors – finding your curated set of people, or board of advisors to look up is immensely powerful.

Here are a few things I have learnt from them

**#𝟭** 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘂𝗽 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁

Things will fail and when they do, how you address it makes all the difference. When you are having a difficult conversation it is you vs them and their failures or do you look at it as you and the person together against the problem. 

People usually don’t want to mess up – and adapting a growth mindset – that folks are and can change is a self fulfilling prophecy.

**#𝟮** 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘂𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗮𝘆 𝗻𝗼 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆 

One that will catapult us to success or never come again. And most of the time, that isn’t true. If someone is choosing you, it means you are doing something right. And that is the biggest opportunity you can recieve – and if you continue to do good work , those opportunities will continue – and improve – over time

**#𝟯** 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲 

All good things in life come from compounding. Give before you take. Put in the grunt work before you ask what’s in it for me. Do the right thing even if no one is watching.

**#𝟰** 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅 𝗼𝗻 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝘃𝘀 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴

We are oft at a point in life when we want to move away from something. Focus efforts instead on moving towards something that aligns with you authentically.

**#5** 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗶𝘅 𝗮 𝗿𝗼𝗼𝗳 𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴

We have this sense of expected fairness from the world – we tend to think that bad thing happens to others – be it at work or health. If you are getting kidnapped and being pulled into a car – the best time to fight is right then – fight your fight upfront. 

Network before you have you. Work on your health before you need to.

Warm, authentic and deeply intelligent, [Guru Bhat](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) sets the bar of what I expect from every leader – and hopefully from myself. 

[Krishnan S Iyer](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) is the impeccable and suave CEO – always commanding the room with an exec presence worth emulating\]
