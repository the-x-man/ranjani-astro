There are always fires to put out and a never ending list of things to get done.

Nothing is more frustrating than to sit in front of your laptop all day but feel like you haven’t accomplished anything.

Whilst days and months roll by.

A recent practice I have been adopting based on [Matt Mochary](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s framework inspired by Cal Newport’s book, ‘Deep Work’ is the ‘Top Goal Framework’

**“Schedule two hours each day to work on your Top Goal only. And do this every single workday. Period”**

“During this Top Goal time, do not respond to emails, texts, calls, and messages. Only work on your top priority during these two hours”

If 2 hours is too much, start with 30 mins.

I use a kanbanboard pomodoro to keep me on track.

Do you deep work?
