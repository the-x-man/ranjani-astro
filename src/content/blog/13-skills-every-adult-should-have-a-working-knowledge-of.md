13 skills every adult should have a working knowledge of

“I made a list of skills in which I think every adult should gain a working knowledge.

I wouldn’t expect you to become a master of any, but mastery isn’t necessary.

Luck has a good chance of finding you if you become merely good in most of these areas.

I’ll make a case for each one, but here’s the preview list.

**#1** Public speaking

**#2** Psychology

**#3** Business Writing

**#4** Accounting

**#5** Design (the basics)

**#6** Conversation

**#7** Overcoming Shyness

**#8** Second language

**#9** Golf

**#10** Proper grammar

**#11** Persuasion

**#12** Technology ( hobby level)

**#13** Proper voice technique”

― Scott Adams, How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life

I found this list (and the book) quite intriguing.

Which of the above have you invested in yourself/trained for?
