Are you above average? Is your child an A student?

Is your employee an introvert or an extrovert?

Every day we are measured against the yardstick of averages, judged according to how closely we come to it or how far we deviate from it.

The assumption that metrics comparing us to an average—like GPAs, personality test results, and performance review ratings—reveal something meaningful about our potential is so ingrained in our consciousness that we don’t even question it.

That assumption, says Harvard’s Todd Rose, is spectacularly—and scientifically—wrong
