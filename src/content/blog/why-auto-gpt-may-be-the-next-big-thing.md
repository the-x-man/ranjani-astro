Ok. AutoGPT might just be the next big step in AI.

Here is a video from twitter user @SullyOmarr on building a complex website that ‘Took \~10 minutes at a cost of $0.50″

Here’s why Karpathy recently said “AutoGPT is the next frontier of prompt engineering”

You can now give a task to an AI agent and have it autonomously develop and manage different kinds of tasks

“1 GPT call is a bit like 1 thought. Stringing them together in loops creates agents that can perceive, think, and act, their goals defined in English in prompts,” stated Andrej Karpathy, predicting a future of “AutoOrgs” made up of “AutoCEOs,” “AutoCFOs,” and so on.

– Like creating a website in mins

– or Parsing through Amazon to pick up the prices for identified products

AutoGPT has internet access, long-term and short-term memory management, text generation, and integration with 11 Labs (AI text to speech gen)

And it can operate ‘autonomously’

And I am done book-marking AI links – it genuinely is a space that is too fast to catch up
