All time isn’t created equal.

Dad was always the ambitious one at his career – he was probably the most sought out person at his workplace.

He was a proud man – proud that he was close to indispensable. He held to his beliefs and integrity, spending close to 3 decades at the place, growing steadily through the ranks.

Everyone loved ‘Mani saar’.

Until he turned 50 and was forced to stop working due to health concerns. His world and his identity came crashing down.

All the things he planned and wanted to do – were now only pipe dreams.

Amongst every other way, it impacted us and me, the one that I hold dearest is ‘Time is a premium’ – you never know how much time you have left.

We treat money as a currency to optimize – whilst the one that we should be concerned about is time.

We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over a year.

I singularly value my time over everything else.

It explains why I am always looking at figuring out what I need to say no to and what high leverage activities to focus on.

Leverage is a powerful mental model that has applications across all aspects of life.

Gaining Disproportionate Outcomes comes from identifying how you spend your time on high leverage activities.

Ones where you can achieve a large increase in output for a relatively small amount of additional input.

“You’re spending time to save money when you should be spending money to save time”
