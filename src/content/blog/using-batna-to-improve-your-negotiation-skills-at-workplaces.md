Whether you do it consciously it or not, you are constantly negotiating at workplaces

For a pay raise, for a different role, a new project or a flexible work schedule

And ‘Negotiation’ is one of those life-skills that every adult should gain a working knowledge

I was reminded of BATNA thanks to Shyam Sadasivan’s brilliant carousel earlier today.

BATNA stands for ‘best alternative to a negotiated agreement’

When you know what you’ll do if you don’t reach a deal, you can compare that possibility to whatever deal is on the table.

The more appealing your best alternative is, the more comfortable you will feel asking for more in your current negotiation

Example – A homebuyer could improve her power in a negotiation with a seller by finding another house she likes just as much.

So before you step into any negotiations, please take the time to identify what is your BATNA

BATNA strategy (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) was first introduced in the book, Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In, Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton (Penguin, 1991) as “the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured.”
