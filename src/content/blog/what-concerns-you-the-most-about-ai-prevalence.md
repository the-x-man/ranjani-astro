What concerns you most about AI?

Yes, there are fears around the AI prevalence, downsides and impact to jobs

While that is an understandable concerns, what worries me the most is this – free markets don’t prioritise to reduce inequity, by default.

“….market forces won’t naturally produce AI products and services that help the poorest.

The opposite is more likely”

What worries me is how we can ensure leveraging tech for good

To solve to reducing inequity vs worsening the gap.

For the thousands who aren’t even aware of how this could and would impact them.

How do we leverage tech for good?

Gates proposes this – “With reliable funding and the right policies, governments and philanthropy can ensure that AIs are used to reduce inequity. Just as the world needs its brightest people focused on its biggest problems, we will need to focus the world’s best AIs on its biggest problems.”

What are your thoughts on this?
