Book – [Super Thinking: Upgrade Your Reasoning and Make Better Decisions with Mental Models](https://www.amazon.in/Superthinking-Upgrade-Reasoning-Better-Decisions/dp/024133635X/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=X0PLTKKKW7IH&dchild=1&keywords=superthinking&qid=1596543110&s=books&sprefix=superthi%2Cstripbooks%2C288&sr=1-1)

So you sent a message and have received an single ‘OK’ in response. Or worse still haven’t got a response at all for your proposal. Before you fume in anger and conclude that the other person is dismissive of you, pause to consider Hanlon’s Razor that may provide an alternative (and simpler explanation) for it.

The world’s greatest problem-solvers, forecasters, and decision-makers all rely on a set of frameworks and shortcuts that help them cut through complexity and separate good ideas from bad ones.

These are mental models.

The book, Superthinking, is a illustrated guide of every mental model you’d need to make better decisions, be less wrong, deal with conflict and unlock your potential.
