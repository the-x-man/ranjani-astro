In 12th, I scored around 97% in Science and Math. I was sure I would study medicine  
  
It seemed possible going by the previous year’s cut-off scores. So my parents and I went to the Common Entrance Cell hoping to score a ‘free’ General Merit seat within the city.  
  
Why not outside?  
  
Because my parents had apparently heard of horror stories of how it was unsafe for girls with rampant ragging.  
  
Long story short, the person a couple of places ahead of me, picked the last one in Bangalore.  
  
I refused to budge hoping for a miracle. None happened.  
  
A month after I started my engineering degree, my mom got back from work, utterly upset about having been misled,  
  
Apparently, she had taken the advice of her senior at her government job, who had a son in his 2nd year of medicine.  
  
Who now scornfully called out that while it was alright for my mom to dream big, it was ridiculous to imagine she could have her daughter in the same position as that of his son.  
  
No, I don’t regret my Hobson’s choice.  
  
The point is – Whenever possible, seek out knowledge.  
  
Do not buy bitcoins because Elon tweeted so.  
Or pick a data science course because a cousin said it is the next hot thing.  
  
Do your research.
