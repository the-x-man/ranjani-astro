Imagine if you could talk to a dead celebrity with AI?

Are you looking for accurate answers? Maybe not. Because there are no right/wrong answers

Business outcomes on the other hand, require accuracy

Which is why Gen AI in B2B works better as a ‘coaching network’ as Emergence puts it.

Here is why the state of Gen AI today works differently for B2B vs B2C use cases

![1️⃣](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/31-20e3.svg) Play COACH to humans where accuracy is critical – Business use cases require accuracy. “In order for businesses to feel confident in using generative AI for most use cases, more context and human assistance will be required”

![2️⃣](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/32-20e3.svg) GenAI is Output oriented, not outcome oriented – “ChatGPT can spit out taglines for a new beverage brand, but it can’t tell you which one performs better”

Businesses are usually driven by outcomes.

![3️⃣](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/33-20e3.svg) GenAI is broad vs deep

“…to move the needle in many business use cases, the AI needs to be trained on company-specific data”

Foundational base models today lack context to specific use cases. This is where fine-tuning specific models with specific data over base models, could provide ‘strong, defensible ROI”
