Metaverse and How it Will Change the World with [Matthew Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)

[Sahil Bloom](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)‘s podcast episode with him on “Where it Happens”, is singularly one of the best things I have heard in recent times

Here are 5 reasons why

I am a futurist at heart – thus Metaverse and how that could shape our tech trajectory continues to be niggling question.

**#1** While I tend to think tech isn’t inherently good or bad but depends on the intentions of the user, Metaverse is a space I don’t know where to stand.

Partially because I don’t know enough – and largely because we are shaped by narratives. As a binge consumer of sci-fi genre, SnowCrash, Ender’s game, Klara and the Sun… all tend to portray a dystopian future.

Mathew makes a solid point around how utopia doesn’t create drama and how dystopia thus drives the tropes we see around us.

**#2** As we unravel the parallel world online, there are a lot of good questions but we are yet to work out good answers. Like ownership, or governance or how we can drive consensus based behavior.

**#3** How does social media go from what we describe to where we live?

I loved the distinction Matthew Ball made in terms of how Facebook isn’t how we live life, but how we represent it. The Metaverse on the other hand is where we will live out our actions.

That showcases the humongous challenge that lies in creating a persistent infrastructure with new rules powered with massive computational power.

**#4** Would we know when it ‘arrives’?

Did we looking back know how we arrived to this state – what are the indicators we ought to look for? And how the need to decentralize( or rather move away from centralization) has driven us to where we are today

**#5** Finally, the most important question – what does it mean to us all. Are we doomed to a future that we don’t design. How do I raise my kid? What would she do in the face of her peers who grow up with Roblox?

I personally think it is a convoluted question to answer. I like his optimism in each of us holding a sense of agency in creating a future we would love to live in.

And as a parent, a persistent thread that continues to run in my head – around how I can provide the opportunities to my kid to help reach her potential

Irrespective of where she comes from.

I just picked up the book and will share a review shortly.

In the meantime, give this a listen.
