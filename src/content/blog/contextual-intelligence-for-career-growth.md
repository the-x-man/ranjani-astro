Contextual intelligence for career growth – 12 behaviors to know where you stand

‘The most successful people are usually characterized as being able to see things clearly in a way that few others do

This ability has little to do with being brilliant academically

Rather being able to understand change, adapt to it and know how to use it, so that instead of affecting you, it helps you to improve’

Matthew Kutz, a psychology professor at Texas State University,

established up to 12 associated behaviors:

1\. Future mentality: you like to progress and you are very clear about what you want to achieve.

2\. Ability to influence: you use interpersonal skills to positively and non-coercively affect the actions and decisions of others.

3\. Social responsibility: you express concern about social trends and problems.

4\. Cultural sensitivity: you promote and favour diversity in a variety of contexts.

5\. Multicultural leadership: you can influence the behaviours and attitudes of peers within an ethnically diverse context.

6\. Context analysis: you know how to interpret and react appropriately to a changing and volatile environment.

7\. Change agent: you have the courage to ask tough questions and are proactive in facing challenges, leading, participating or making changes.

8\. Constructive use of influence: you use interpersonal skills and your personal influence to constructively and effectively affect the behaviour and decisions of others.

9\. Analysis of your knowledge: you evaluate your own work and are aware of your strengths and weaknesses.

10\. Critical thinking: you are able to establish connections or relationships between different areas, fields or environments, thereby obtaining novel points of view and opinions, which are not usually reached by the majority.

11\. Consensus builder: you display interpersonal skills and convince others to see a different point of view through the use of listening skills, conflict management and creating win-win situations.

12\. Mission awareness: in environments where a certain level of hierarchy can occur, you understand and are able to show how the individual performance of others influences the perception of colleagues, subordinates and managers.

How many of these do you use?
