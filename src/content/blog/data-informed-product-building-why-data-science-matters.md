How does Data Science help in building products in a startup?

A 101 guide

On my journey back home from my vacation, I met a tech startup founder who asked ‘what is the role of data science in building products’?

While it is easy for folks to conflate AI and data science in terms of model building, in essence, DS ‘reduces uncertainty’ and allows a company to compete through understanding the vast unstructured data across multiple data sources

Sequoia did a great write-up on Data informed Product building highlighting the below 4 outcomes

**#1Evaluating** the health of the business : Defining, monitoring, measuring and understanding product health, drivers and variations

**#2Shipping** the right products and features : DS helps drive multiple experiments to guide product teams on optimizing for the product based on insights and ensuring the right features get built

**#3Forecast** Outcomes with Prototypes/ Production ML models : Support forecasting future expectations and trends with AI/ML. Ex – think identifying fraudulent activity using production systems

**#4Drive** Product Roadmap and Strategy : Understand user behavior and journey to help set roadmap and strategy

Data informed decision making for startups in building products can be a huge competitive advantage and a differentiator, if set up correctly.

Are you effectively leveraging datascience in your startup for data informed product building?

If you are a start-up seeking to understand how to leverage AI/ML, would love to hear from you
