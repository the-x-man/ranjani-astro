Book 51/52

Rating – 4/5

Book – [The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse](https://www.amazon.in/Boy-Mole-Fox-Horse/dp/0062976583)

This is a book I bought for my 5 year old

As I read this out to her, I paused multiple times as tears welled up in my eyes.

It is so precious and timeless that it is relevant to pretty much anyone across ages.

With beautiful illustrations, charming handwriting and sentences that convey life’s truth in simple, albeit powerful ways, it’s hard not to fall in love with this book.

It introduces us to the precocious boy – Charlie and his 3 unlikely friends – the mole, the horse and the fox on the journey uncovering life’s lessons

It’s about friendship and kindness, of love and bravery, of hardships and homecoming and about doing the right thing.

It is a book that I wished would go on post the 20 mins it took for me to finish reading it.

So much so that I listened to the audible version of it – which is equally heartwarming – with all the background music.

It could seem like a collection of feel-good and inspirational quotes – but in the uncertain times we live in, we could all do with some goodness and hope.

I can’t do the review without reading out some of these gorgeous lines

> “What do you want to be when you grow up”  
>  
> “Kind”

Do yourself a favor and pick this up for your child, your mom or yourself this festive season

It feels like a warm cup of cocoa on a rainy day. And a book that reminds us of the good left in humanity – even in trying times.
