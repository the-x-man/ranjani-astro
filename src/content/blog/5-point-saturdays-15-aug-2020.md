Hi All!

Here is your weekly dose of “5 Point Saturdays,” interesting tidbits from what I have been Reading: Latest reviews, Books, Weekly challenges, Learning Hacks, and More!

##### **Point \[1\] – What I’m reading** 

[Monk and the Riddle: The Art of Creating a Life While Making a Living](https://www.amazon.in/Monk-Riddle-Creating-Making-Living/dp/1578516447/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dchild=1&keywords=the+monk+and+the+riddle&qid=1597405381&sr=8-1). Here is one of my favorite quotes in the piece:

> “.._And then there is the most dangerous risk of all — the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later._”

##### **Point 2\] What I came across this week that really impacted me** 

21 Principles for Innovating – from IDEO’s partner, Diego Rodriguez I’ve been doing this online course from Stanford on ‘[Leading Innovation](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xine229-leading-innovation)‘ . As part of the module that talks about the differences between creative and routine work, the professor introduces IDEO’s former partner Diego Rodriguez and his 21 principles for Innovation. The 19th principle is to ‘Be remarkable’. I created a PDF version of the 21 principles that you can download for free from [here – 21 Principles of Innovation](https://ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21PrinciplesforInnovation-1.pdf). 

##### **Point 3\] Weekly Challenge that I’m playing around with**

21 day Food Journaling Challenge**.** You can only manage what you measure! I use this simple version of a food tracking journal to capture anything I eat, including liquids. Apart from providing me startling revelations of the quantity I consume, this also has been helping create a Pavlovian response – I don’t eat that cookie since I don’t want to write it on the journal! Find a free pdf download of the planner I use [here](https://ranjanimani.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Food-Journal.jpg)!

##### **Point 4\] What I’m listening to** 

**“**[**LEAP – Stanford eCorner Podcast series**](https://ecorner.stanford.edu/series/leap/)**”** (it takes a deep dive into how to launch your career by unpacking the often overlooked and under-taught soft skills critical to the success of every entrepreneur) hosted by Stanford Professor, [Tina Seelig](https://ecorner.stanford.edu/contributor/tina-seelig/)

##### **Point 5\] Book I read but won’t review!** 

Sometimes, the back to back reading \[and listening\] of non-fiction is overwhelming and like a friend pointed out, one needs a ‘palate cleanser’ that is light and doesn’t need us to think.

This time, I picked up this adorable British romantic comedy, touted as the bestseller for 2019 – [The Flatshare](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36478784-the-flatshare), Beth O’Leary

Quite a unique storyline, captured in a quite an heartwarming manner.

Here is the Goodreads synopsis of the book:

Tiffy and Leon share a flat

Tiffy and Leon share a bed

Tiffy and Leon have never met…

Tiffy Moore needs a cheap flat, and fast. Leon Twomey works nights and needs cash. Their friends think they’re crazy, but it’s the perfect solution: Leon occupies the one-bed flat while Tiffy’s at work in the day, and she has the run of the place the rest of the time.

But with obsessive ex-boyfriends, demanding clients at work, wrongly imprisoned brothers and, of course, the fact that they still haven’t met yet, they’re about to discover that if you want the perfect home you need to throw the rulebook out the window…

Everyone deserves some goofy laughs – go ahead and pick up the book [here](https://www.amazon.in/Flatshare-Beth-OLeary-ebook/dp/B07DCZ7LM4/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dchild=1&keywords=Flatshare&qid=1597406945&sr=8-1). No one is judging you 🙂
