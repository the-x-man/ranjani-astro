I was recently re-watching the series, House.

There is this episode featuring a doctor who gave up on her cancer research when she was quite close to figuring a cure.

She decides to drop it all one fine day – to become a sous chef and attend book clubs.

There is a lot of discussion on whether to be ‘happy’ or ‘fulfilled’ in life. And can one really be both?

“Won’t you feel terrible about all the lives you could have saved, but chose not to, when on your death bed?”, she is judged.

“I might be”, she says, “on the day of my death, but at least I’d be happy on the remaining 25,000 days that I am alive”

To know that is one thing. To have the gumption to do that, quite another 🙂

Do you hustle or do you live your present?

There have been umpteen posts about the hustle culture and also on the flip side, about people deeply rethinking their priorities after a life affirming emergencies.
