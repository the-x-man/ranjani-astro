We are not training GPT 5 right now says Sam Altman.

“An earlier version of the letter claimed OpenAI is training GPT-5 right now. We are not and won’t for some time.

We are doing other things on top of GPT-4 that I think have all sorts of safety issues that are important to address and were totally left out”

Sam Altman, in an address at MIT, responded to the letter calling for a 6 month halt in AI.

He also adds that ‘We believe putting it out in the world will help us understand upsides and downsides and is worth the tradeoff even though we can end up embarrassing ourselves sometimes”

What are your thought on the need for regulation to deal with the disruption from **#GenerativeAI**?
