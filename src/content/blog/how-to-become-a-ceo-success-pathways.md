How do I become the CEO?

‘What got you here, won’t get you there’ is a brilliant book on the topic of scaling as a leader.

The idea being, what helped you in your individual contributor journey may not be the same traits that could help you navigate the C suite

So what qualities differentiates a CEO from the rest?

The article talks about three distinct pathways that the most successful C-suite residents tend to leverage.

**#1Fixer** : Being a “fixer.” From an early age, people with this type of capability naturally see how things in their organization could run better. They instinctively rethink systems, processes, and reporting structures — even before they have the authority to change anything.

**#2RelationshipMaven** : Being a “relationship maven.” Leaders with this skill have a natural curiosity about other people, which starts early in their careers. As they progress in their careers and their network of “friends” grows, these leaders instinctively start bringing different people together in rooms to pull off deals and collaborations that get bigger over time — yielding results others have a difficult time replicating.

**#3PassionPlayer** : Being a “passion player.” These leaders believe that accomplishing something significant is what matters, and they use that belief to recruit and motivate others to their cause. They are often deep experts in a particular area, bringing tremendous business knowledge and/or strategic thinking to a particular topic, that helps make the story behind their passion compelling to a broad array of stakeholders.

Maybe you don’t want the CEO title but yearn to make an impact – nonetheless, it sounds like the key is to identify what your natural strengths are and to play towards those pathways. Intentionally.

“People don’t walk into the top spot. They’re driven”

Where do you think your core strengths lie? Do you think you have a combination of these skills?
