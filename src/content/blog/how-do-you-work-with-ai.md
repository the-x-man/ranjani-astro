Do not use AI as a 0 or 1 option. But rather as a co-pilot to help you work better and faster.

Say you want to write about a topic – thinking about it in extremes is flawed ie, I will write it myself from scratch or I need AI to give me a completely automated version

Rather think of it as a coach – one that can help you get started

And one you can fine-tune further

Below is a blog outline for a Gen AI tech stack 101 written completely by AI.

Is it perfect? No.

Is it aligned to what I had in mind? No

Is it a good first step? Yes

Learning to work along with AI is possibly the one skill I’d recommend all of us master
