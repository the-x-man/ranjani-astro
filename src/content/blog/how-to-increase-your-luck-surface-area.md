You don’t control you Luck

But you can increase your Luck Surface Area

“In philosophy, a razor is a principle or rule of thumb that allows one to eliminate unlikely explanations for a phenomenon, or avoid unnecessary actions”

Of all the razors, this is one of my favourites.

At any point in time, work towards increasing your luck surface area.

How? Help luck work for you

For example, attend a meet-up about a passionate topic vs bingeing on a new series

Meet folks across the org for a virtual coffee chat

Always help connect folks to opportunities even when it may not work for you

Be nice and be respectful

Check in with your mentors even when you don’t need to.

Spend 25 mins each day learning about a topic you want to master.

Experiment vs Planning

“Start Doing, Amplify by Telling”
