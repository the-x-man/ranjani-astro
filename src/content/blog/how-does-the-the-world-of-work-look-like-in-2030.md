How do you think work has changed over the last 15 years?

In one word – Unrecognisably

This picture is from an offsite from my first job at [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) – 15 years ago. Fresh-faced and naive.

“Change happens slowly and then all at once”

The futurist (and optimist) that I am, I oft think about how will work will look like in 10 years.

And more importantly, what do we tell our children

As a PWC report called out, ‘This isn’t a time to sit back and wait for events to unfold. To be prepared for the future you have to understand it”

There are 5 Megatrends that the report calls out that will shape that narrative

**#1Technological** breakthroughs – Rapid advances in technological innovation

**#2Demographic** shifts – The changing size, distribution and age profile of the world’s population

**#3Rapid** urbanisation – Significant increase in the world’s population moving to live in cities

**#4Shifts** in global economic power – Power shifting between developed and developing countries

**#5Resource** scarcity and climate change – Depleted fossil fuels, extreme weather, rising sea levels and water shortages

It further talks about 4 different worlds of work in 2030

– The Yellow World (Humans come first)

– The Red World (Innovation rules)

– The Green World (Companies care)

– The Blue World (Corporate is king)

I personally believe it could be a combination of these, swayed largely by what you do and where you live.

So here is the thing about change and the future – while we can worry about automation and losing jobs, the future is what we make of it.

So what can we tell our children?

“That to stay ahead, you need to focus on your ability to continuously adapt, engage with others in that process, and most importantly retain your core sense of identity and values.

And that the future isn’t a fixed destination”

That is **#MyWorkPrediction**. What is yours?

\[P.S – If you are wondering what we are all staring at – it was our boss who was trying to climb up the tree!

Maybe some things don’t change – I have been lucky to have brilliant leaders all through :)\]
