##### #3 Distributed Enterprise – Top Technology Trends 2022

1) **WHY** – Gartner pegs two reasons for the rise of this trend

a) COVID driven remote-first working had organizations require different tools and increased flexibility

b) Consumers increasingly aren’t available via traditional, physical avenues

2) **WHAT** – Distributed enterprise is a virtual-fist, remote-first architectural approach to digitize consumer touch-points and build out experiences to support products.

3) **WHERE** is it used today? ‘Armoire’s digital dressing room allows customers to try styles virtually.

Traditional office-centric organizations are evolving into distributed enterprises comprised of geographically dispersed workers.
