Elon Musk, Memes and Tesla

In one of his Clubhouse appearances, Elon Musk was asked about his love of memes:

“It is safe to say that you might be the master of the memes, and in fact you had a quote that “Who controls the memes controls the universe.” Can you just explain what you meant by that?”

Elon : It’s a play on words from Dune, “Who controls the spice controls the universe”, and if memes are spice then it’s memes.

… How do things become interesting to people?

… I don’t know, I love memes, I think they can be very insightful, and you know throughout history, symbolism in general has powerfully affected people”

In his brilliant blog, [Stratechery](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), Ben Thomson makes the analogy of the meme with Tesla as a symbol.

“The real payoff of Musk’s “Master Plan” is the fact that Tesla means something: yes, it stands for sustainability and caring for the environment, but more important is that Tesla also means amazing performance and Silicon Valley cool”
