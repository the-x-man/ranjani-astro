💫 JUST IN – Meta AI just released SAM (Segment Anything Model).

✅ It can “cut out” any object, in any image, with a single click and can identify objects within images & videos, even those it hasn’t encountered before.

✅ Segmentation — identifying which image pixels belong to an object — is a core task in computer vision and is used in a broad array of applications, from analyzing scientific imagery to editing photos.

\>> Segment Anything: Works toward the first foundation model for image segmentation

✅ It was built with a goal to build a foundation model for image segmentation: a promptable model that is trained on diverse data and that can adapt to specific tasks, analogous to how prompting is used in natural language processing model

✅ In the future, SAM could be used to help power applications in numerous domains that require finding and segmenting any object in any image. For the AI research community and others, SAM could become a component in larger AI systems for more general multimodal understanding of the world

Imagine the list of possibilities this can bring in across manufacturing to healthcare – from automated quality control with vision systems to improving medical imaging analysis
