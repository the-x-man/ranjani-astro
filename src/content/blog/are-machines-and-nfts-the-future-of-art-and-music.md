Are Machines and NFT’s the Future of art and music?

Mitosis is a two-minute video loop made up of over 750,000 faces continually being generated by a GAN.

It is under bidding at Sotheby’s for \~76K USD as a curated NFT.

The owner Mario Klignemann has used an endlessly moving and changing artwork – images created not by the human artist but by the machine.

The other image shows how an artificial neural network “sees” the Vincent Van Gogh’s most renowned paintings “Starry Night.” 

As an Nautilus article sums up beautifully,

“AI art like Klingemann’s shows that machines can imagine what we cannot imagine and see what we cannot see. 

The point is not whether we can distinguish AI-created music from human music but whether machines will be able to create music of their own, music we cannot imagine”
