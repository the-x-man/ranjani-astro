Look at who joined me at [Indian Institute of Management Bangalore](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) yesterday for a session on **#AIAdoption** for the [Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) community.

Fascinated with the lush green campus and miffed that she didn’t get a stage, A has promised she will start a Youtube channel to ‘teach kids AI’ 😀

It’s endearing to see how easily kids take to technology – as a parent and as a person who works in AI, I sway each day between excitement and fear.

Remind me of Dickens’

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”

Thanks Professor [Dinesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), [Harini Thammaiah](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and the WIDS Bangalore team!

Thoroughly enjoyed being part of the event
