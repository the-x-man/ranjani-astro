What can startups learn about product lifecycle from Netflix’ recent Venture Into Gaming

Netflix’s is an interesting case study to all startups on how to own the product lifecycle

Broadening prospects and identifying new revenue streams once they reached the maturity stage

**#Stage1** They started with DVD sales and rentals \[ a now declined and phased out part of the lifecycle\]

**#Stage2** Then moved into subscription services streaming services \[A mature market..\]

**#Stage3** And into Creating Original content with “Netflix Originals” \[a growing space albeit with an influx of new entrants and content glut\]

And now with an influx of companies in this space, Netflix is looking at adding games to streaming platform in the next year

This marks their foray and increased focus on interactive content

They aren’t just a streaming platform competing with HBO or Disney

Rather they are competing for attention in an already content rich environment

Thoughts on Netflix’s strategy?
