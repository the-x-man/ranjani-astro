Spicy Topic – Should we let our children play and understand AI tools?

Under parental guidance.

In an article, “We Can’t Keep ChatGPT Out of the Classroom, so Let’s Address the ‘Why’ Behind Our Fears’, an English teacher highlights this –

“ChatGPT offers us an opportunity to address our fears, release our fixation on preventing cheating and focus our attention on more worthy priorities: providing students with compelling reasons to write, inviting them to wrestle with important questions and crafting a piece of writing that cannot be mistaken for a robot’s work”

A lot of what we force our children to do is rote learning and writing – efforts better spent in understanding concepts vs regurgitation.

And keeping them away from learning what is shaping the tech world is akin to leaving them with a handicap.

Teach them how to amplify their efforts working with a tool, not to outsource to it.

For a human with a tool will beat a human without one.

Here is an image my almost 8 year old created using an AI based image generator that in the backend uses controlled diffusion models.
