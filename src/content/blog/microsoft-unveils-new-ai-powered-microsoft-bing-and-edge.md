Microsoft unveils new Bing, Edge browser backed by upgraded OpenAI language model

[Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) yesterday announced the new AI powered browser – prompting me to try it for the first time ever 😉

“We’ve updated the Edge browser with new AI capabilities and a new look, and we’ve added two new functionalities: Chat and compose.

With the Edge Sidebar, you can ask for a summary of a lengthy financial report to get the key takeaways – and then use the chat function to ask for a comparison to a competing company’s financials and automatically put it in a table.

You can also ask Edge to help you compose content, such as a LinkedIn post, by giving it a few prompts to get you started. After that, you can ask it to help you update the tone, format and length of the post. Edge can understand the web page you’re on and adapts accordingly.”

I quite like the side-bar functionality – extremely intuitive and I can imagine the huge productivity gains it adds.

Imagine writing a LinkedIn post and working on improving the tone.

Maybe [Vignesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) wont have to ask me to review the tone of his posts anymore 🙂
